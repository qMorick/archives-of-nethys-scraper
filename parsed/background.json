Jealous rivals. Endless fame. The promise of all this and more is what drove you to enter this year's Ruby Phoenix Tournament, and with your prodigious star power it's no wonder why they selected you for the prequalifier on Danger Island. You've got champion stamped all over you. Obviously, the organizers knew a winner when they saw one. It's already clear that you'll be named Ruby Phoenix Champion—the challenges leading up to your prize ceremony are mere formalities, but you're happy to indulge the impassioned masses. After all, the people want a show, and what kind of celebrity would you be if you denied them? You might even deign to compete in some fights, too, as long as your hair doesn't get mussed. Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Strength or Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost. You're trained in the Performance skill, and the Gladiatorial Lore skill.

You're trained in one skill related to the prophecy, and the Fortune-Telling Lore skill. You gain the Prophecy's Pawn free action. Prophecy's Pawn Free Action (abjuration, divine, fortune) Trigger You fail a saving throw, attack roll, or skill check; Effect You twist the prophecy in your favor, which will have consequences later. Reroll the failed check. You must use the result of the second roll. For 24 hours afterward, the GM can force you to reroll a successful saving throw, attack roll, or skill check as fate balances the scale. This is a misfortune effect. You can't use prophecy's pawn again until the GM uses this option or 24 hours pass, whichever comes first.",

You made a good deal of money selling firearms from the Gunworks to people who perhaps shouldn't have had them. You even worked with wasteland marauders a few times, sticking up Ustradi barges plying the river between the Gunworks and Alkenstar. Of course, you never hurt any innocents or did anything truly heinous; your criminal career was always just a matter of money. One day, a corrupt financier named Ambrost Mugland—a true crook if there ever was one—approached you, demanding a cut of your business. When you refused, he put in a word with the shieldmarshals that you'd be a certain somewhere at a certain time with a certain large quantity of illegally obtained firearms. Even though you escaped arrest, your identity was compromised, and your old accomplices have all turned their backs on you. Your gun-running days are clearly over. Now, you're just running. Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost. You're trained in the Stealth skill, and the Firearm Lore skill. You gain the Experienced Smuggler skill feat.",

You remember your life before your death and now live with an extra lifetime of knowledge. Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence , and one is a free ability boost. You become trained in two Lore skills, which you and your GM choose from Lore skills associated with your past life. At 3rd level, 7th level, and 15th level, you receive skill increases, which you can apply only to these Lore skills. In certain situations analogous to your past life, fragments of memories resurface, potentially helping or distracting you. The GM can offer you a +1 circumstance bonus on skill checks with either of these Lore skills or on other skill checks that echo your past life. If you accept but fail the check, you're stupefied 1 for 1 minute by the mental distraction of your past-life memories, or stupefied 2 for 1 minute on a critical failure.",

On the night of the Missing Moment, all the many exciting occasions you've experienced paled in comparison to the vision of fantastic lands and incredible people you saw on the other side of the glowing gate. You stepped through in the hopes of finally reaching the thrilling highs you so desperately seek, but as soon as you'd gone there you were again, standing in front of a lightless gateway with a months-long gap in your memories. Frustrated at having come so close to achieving your dreams, you swung at a nearby tree, smashing it to splinters with surprising strength you never knew you had. This strange new brawn wasn't what you asked for—but it might help you pursue the excitement you crave. Your deviant abilities are of the troll classification. You gain the Titan Swing deviant feat. As a quirk, whenever you use a deviant ability, your feet elongate and your leg bones crack as your lower limbs transform into those of a rabbit, wolf, or other spry, long-heeled animal. Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and one is a free attribute boost. You're trained in the Nature skill, and the Stabling Lore skill. You gain the Express Rider skill feat.",

  "text": " Crown of Chaos Source Stolen Fate Player's Guide pg. 11 Your life was one of tumult and mayhem, but you don't see this as a bad thing. Perhaps you lived life on the road as part of an ever-changing group, such as being a member of a traveling circus or part of a years-long pilgrimage with a group of explorers. Maybe you were a member of a large family and found the best way to get attention was to be unpredictable. Or you could have grown up in a region where society had collapsed, such as a war zone or ruined city after a disaster, where you were forced to constantly think on your feet to handle unexpected situations. One thing you've certainly excelled at is developing the skill of lying to strangers in order to put them at ease. Is it really a bad thing to lie, after all, if the end result is good for both sides? Or at the very least, good for you? This background is associated with the suit of Crowns. Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma , and one is a free ability boost. You gain the Charming Liar skill feat and are trained in a Lore about a specific terrain, as befits where you spent most of your childhood growing up. You also gain the following free action. Chaotic Destiny Free Action (fortune) Trigger You fail a saving throw during a combat; Frequency once per day; Effect Chaos intervenes on your behalf at the last instant as you fail a saving throw. Draw a harrow card and reroll the saving throw you failed. You must take the result of the reroll, but if you drew a card from the suit of Crowns, improve the result by one degree of success.",

A Quick Glimpse Beyond Free Action (fortune) Trigger You attempt a secret check; Frequency once per day; Effect You can roll the secret check yourself rather than have the GM roll it. As you roll, draw a harrow card. If the card drawn is from the suit of Stars, the next secret check you make during the next 24 hours can also be rolled by you. Each time you roll your own additional secret check in this way, draw a new harrow card, and each time you draw a card from the suit of Stars, your next secret check in the next 24 hours can also be rolled by you. If you ever critically fail a secret check that you roll yourself as a result of this ability, fate turns away from you, and your Pilgrim's Token no longer functions until the next time you make your daily preparations.",

You have studied esoteric subjects trying to understand your situation, but this presence in your life remains a mystery. Whatever this entity is or wants, it influences your life in subtle ways, and not always for the better. Sometimes the entity helps you, but at other times, its influence is malevolent or harmful. The entity is most likely to surface in stressful situations. Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma , and one is a free attribute boost. You are trained in Occultism and an additional skill in which the haunting entity is well-versed, determined by the GM. Any time you attempt a skill check for the entity's skill, the GM can offer you a +1 circumstance bonus to the check, as though the entity were Aiding you. If you accept but fail the check, you are frightened 2 (frightened 4 on a critical failure). The initial frightened value can't be reduced by effects that would reduce or prevent the condition (such as a fighter's bravery).",

  "text": " Moot Guard Source Wardens of Wildwood Players Guide pg. 7 You are a respected guardian of the Verduran Forest, and the Wildwood Lodge has called upon you to manage security at their upcoming Greenwood Gala. What deeds earned you such trust and esteem? Perhaps you have skirmished with Taldan poachers, subdued riotous fey festivities, or spent years systematically sabotaging illegal Andoren woodcutting ventures. Maybe you are officially part of the Wildwood Lodge, serving as a part- time bodyguard and negotiator to help maintain order— otherwise Taldan nobles might send in their own army to keep the peace. Whatever the case, you know that tensions are building between factions who support and oppose the lodge's current leader, Valenar the Green, and you might have to step in to keep the Greenwood Gala fun and welcoming. Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Strength or Constitution, and one is a free attribute boost. You're trained in the Intimidation skill, and the Warfare Lore skill.

  "text": " Amateur Director Source Curtain Call Player's Guide pg. 13 You grew up a child of the theater. Perhaps your parents were actors or directors, or maybe you fell in with a theater crowd at a young age. Perhaps you and your siblings shared a tradition of putting on plays for your parents or, if you were an only child, maybe you directed your toys and stuffed animals in elaborate productions that played out in your mind. Whatever the case, as you grew older, you found that you were most comfortable helping to organize and facilitate the goals and dreams of others—and not just in the role of being a director for a stage production. You've always derived satisfaction from being the one in charge of something and helping others get organized so as to accomplish something significant. Yet for whatever reason, this never quite grew into your job; you've never actually made money directing, or if you have, it was never enough to allow you to abandon your other responsibilities. Still, the experience you've gained at this amateur work has given you some impressive skills and self-confidence. Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma , and one is a free ability boost. You're trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Theater Lore skill. You gain the Group Impression skill feat. If you have the Leader persona trait, you also become trained in the Scribing Lore skill.",

  "text": " Student of the Ancients Source Shades of Blood Player's Guide pg. 11 Sure, stargazing is fine and all, but you signed up for the expedition to Ancorato so you could visit the remains of the ancient empire of Azlant. A curious child, you had access to books that covered some of the ancient civilizations that thrived before Earthfall and would often get lost in your own imagination of what life was like way back then. You even managed to learn some ancient languages to further your studies by reading the actual words rather than someone else's translations. You hope that when your contract for Inizkar's expedition finishes, you can start your own expedition into the Azlanti ruins. Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma , and one is a free attribute boost. You're trained in the Society skill and the Azlanti Lore skill. You gain the Multilingual skill feat; one language gained must be Azlanti and the other can be any common or uncommon language",

If the haunt succeeds, the target is thrown over the edge of the cliff, where it then falls 120 feet to the ground. Until the haunt is defeated, each creature within 60 feet of the cliff’s edge must attempt a DC 40 Will save each time they would spend an action or reaction to Arrest a Fall, Fly, Grab an Edge, or otherwise avoid falling; if they fail the save, the action is disrupted.

Repulsive Refuse This flood has picked up tainted or disease-ridden objects like sewer runoff or rotting food. It deals 2d12+8 bludgeoning damage. Each creature exposed to the flood must attempt a DC 29 Fortitude save, becoming sickened 1 on a failure or sickened 2 on a critical failure. Additionally, creatures who come into contact with the flood waters are exposed to filth fever (DC 20 Fortitude). Sharp Debris The waters have picked up various objects, some of which are particularly sharp. The flood deals 1d12 bludgeoning damage and 1d12+12 piercing damage. Sticky Goo The substance is particularly sticky. It deals 2d12+6 bludgeoning damage. Additionally, each creature in the flood must attempt a DC 29 Reflex save at the beginning of their turn each round. On a failed saving throw, they take a –10-foot circumstance penalty to all their Speeds for 1 round. On a critical failure, they are instead immobilized for 1 round. ",

Fight! pg. 17 Complexity Complex A portal to the Plane of Air rips open onstage, causing roaring winds to tear through the opera house. --- Stealth +22 (master) to notice the sudden breeze in the theater Disable DC 38 Arcana (master) to sew the magical threads of the rift shut, DC 40 Nature or Survival (legendary) to open enough windows and doors to reduce its intensity, or dispel magic (7th level; counteract DC 34) to counteract the air rift Earth Vulnerability The Elemental Plane of Air is opposed by the Plane of Earth. Any spell or magical effect with the earth trait that targets a creature or area within 50 feet of the rift deals 10 damage to the rift per spell levels (or per 2 levels for magic items, feats, and so forth). For example, a 3rd-level earthbind spell cast on a creature near the air rift deals 30 points of damage to the rift. AC 35, Fort +30 HP 220 Weaknesses earth vulnerabilty Weightlessness Reaction Trigger A creature comes within 50 feet of the rift; Effect The air rift creates a shroud of subjective gravity around the creature for 1 minute. The creature can use a free action, which has the concentrate trait, to choose any direction they wish for gravity to pull them. This allows a creature to Stride along any surface or Fly in a straight line by choosing a direction into midair. For unattended objects and mindless creatures, this is microgravity: they float in place unless pushed off a surface. --- Routine (1 action) Winds blow through the area in a random direction, causing creatures and objects within 50 feet of the air rift to float up, down, north, south, east, or west (roll a d6 to determine which direction). Creatures and objects in the area must attempt a DC 37 Fortitude save. If a creature is pushed into a solid object or another creature by this effect, both take 3d8+15 bludgeoning damage on impact. Critical Success The creature is unaffected. Success The creature is pushed 10 feet, but takes only half damage from impact. Failure The creature is pushed 20 feet, falls prone, and takes full damage from impact. Critical Failure The creature is pushed 40 feet, falls prone, and takes double damage from impact.",

Larger amounts of water, such as a full bucket, typically douse a 10-foot-by-10-foot area (or 4 squares in some other shape). Throwing a bucket of water on flames requires an Interact action. A  waterskin  doesn't contain enough water to put out even 1 square of fire.  Cold  can also put out fire, but only if the cold can affect an area; cold is usually less effective than water, so a  frost vial  typically puts out 1 square of fire, and   ray of frost   is ineffective.   Fountain Circle, located outside town hall, has several working water pumps. These are far enough away that it's impractical for a PC to bring water back and forth. However, a PC might instruct the more steely nerved spectators to create a bucket brigade. It takes 15 spectators (which can include those rescued by councilors as well as by PCs) to set this up, and 2 rounds for the townspeople to line up and begin pumping water from Fountain Circle. As of the 3rd round, there is a bucket of water available for the PCs to use at the chamber's southern entrance at the beginning of each PC's turn. Members of a bucket brigade are lined up outside the chamber, and don't take damage from smoke inhalation.   If a PC does want to carry the water, it's 150 feet from the chamber's southern door to a pump, so it 6 actions are usually needed to reach the pumps or return. Filling a bucket requires an Interact action.   Other methods might also help control the fire, as you determine. For example, the PCs might be able to find something to barricade the fire with to control its path, or use a cloak to beat out some of the fire.",

Water typically clears a 5-foot square if the amount is small (such as that from [_create water_](/Spells.aspx?ID=53) or [_hydraulic push_](/Spells.aspx?ID=154)). Larger amounts of water, such as a full bucket, typically douse a 10-foot-by-10-foot area (or 4 squares in some other shape). Throwing a bucket of water on flames requires an Interact action.

It takes 15 spectators (which can include those rescued by councilors as well as by PCs) to set this up, and 2 rounds for the townspeople to line up and begin pumping water from Fountain Circle. As of the 3rd round, there is a bucket of water available for the PCs to use at the chamber's southern entrance at the beginning of each PC's turn. Members of a bucket brigade are lined up outside the chamber, and don't take damage from smoke inhalation.\n\n If a PC does want to carry the water, it's 150 feet from the chamber's southern door to a pump, so it 6 actions are usually needed to reach the pumps or return. Filling a bucket requires an Interact action.\n\n Other methods might also help control the fire, as you determine.

The water churns through the room and flows out through three chutes on the south end of the room. --- Stealth +17 (expert) or Perception DC 27 (expert) to notice the six cleverly hidden sluice gates while they are closed Disable Thievery DC 28 (expert) twice to close a sluice (on a critical success, a sluice is closed immediately) Sluiceway Hardness 17 Sluiceway HP 38 (BT 34) Immunities critical hits, object immunities, precision damage Opened Sluices Reaction Trigger A creature Interacts to throw either the primary lever or backup lever. Effect The trap rolls initiative. --- Routine (6 actions) The trap loses 1 action per disabled or destroyed sluice. On each of its actions, the water rushing from the sluices flows through the room, creating a river of churning water that fills the room to several inches and makes the floor of the chamber into difficult terrain. The water level never rises above this level in the room, as it drains out of the chutes to the south and begins to flood the quarry pit (area J2). On the trap's second turn, the water starts filling the four slave pits in area J2. Each of the trap's actions fills the pits 4 inches (2 feet per round if all sluices are functional). If the slave pits fill to their total depth of 12 feet and the grates over the slave pits aren't open, the slaves begin to drown, dying if they aren't freed in 5 rounds. Once the slave pits are full, the water continues to slowly fill the central area over the course of an hour until it empties the reservoir and floods area J2 to a depth of 15 feet. Other options beyond disabling or destroying the sluices could prevent the flooding of the quarry pit at your discretion. --- Reset The trap resets if all six sluices are closed. If all the water has drained when this occurs, the water takes many months to refill.",

Localized Dragonstorm Reaction (air) Trigger A new wave begins; Effect Roll 1d10 to determine which effect manifests from the following possibilities. The placement of these effects is guided by Dahak's will, and they should manifest in the most detrimental locations possible to the PCs. 1–2: Acid Rain (acid) A torrent of acid drenches creatures in a 20-foot burst. Creatures in the area take 6d10 acid damage (DC 42 basic Reflex save). Creatures that critically fail also take 5 persistent acid damage. 3–4: Freezing Wind (cold) A barrage of freezing wind and hail assaults all creatures in a 20-foot burst. Creatures in the area take 3d10 cold damage and 3d10 bludgeoning damage (DC 42 basic Reflex save). Creatures that critically fail are slowed 1 for 1 round. 5–6: Bolts of Lightning (electricity) Several bolts of lightning strike all creatures in a 20-foot burst.

Three successes using either skill (or a combination of both) destroys the hazard. Deadly Footing The area of the venom pool is difficult terrain, and each creature moving through it takes 10 acid damage for every square of its area that it moves into. Poison Puff Reaction Trigger A creature moves through any square in the hazard's space; Effect The pool produces a 9th-level cloudkill (DC 40) at its center. It then rolls initiative. --- Routine (2 actions) The hazard uses its first action to spread 10 feet down the hallway in both directions. Once out of the hall, each side spreads in a random direction each round, but they don't go through doors. The hazard uses its second action to move the center of the cloudkill up to 20 feet in any direction to which any part of the pool has line of effect (normally, to encompass the greatest number of characters). If the cloudkill isn't present, it instead uses its second action to produce a new cloudkill, as Poison Puff. --- Reset The hazard ends after 1 minute, contracting to its original size and keeping still until disturbed again.",

The sudden movement causes the thunderstone to clink against the jar and explode. All creatures in a 10-foot radius take 2 sonic damage and must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 round. In addition, each creature in that area is splattered with purple dye and showered with glass, taking 1d4+2 piercing damage (DC 20 basic Reflex save). Creatures splattered with purple dye take a –1 circumstance penalty to Charisma-based skill checks. Fully dying the affected hair or clothing removes this penalty. Dyed skin fades after a week but can be covered up with a successful DC 12 Disguise check and the appropriate cosmetics.",

Any breathing creature in the room is exposed to the toxin. If a creature acts before the trap on the first round, it has the option of holding its breath to postpone breathing in the poison—holding one's breath after the trap's first action has no effect, since the air in the creature's lungs is already tainted. The trap functions for 1 minute before all the gas is expended, after which it rapidly decays over the next minute. Opening the door to an adjacent room cuts the remaining time it takes for the gas to decay in half but exposes creatures in that room as well.

Success The creature disbelieves the illusions but still sees them. It treats the room as difficult terrain. Failure The creature is fooled by the illusions. It treats the room as difficult terrain and becomes sickened 1. As long as it remains in the room, it can't reduce its sickened value below 1. Critical Failure As failure, but each time the creature attempts a move action, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or they lose the action, and on a critical failure, it also falls prone. --- Reset 1 minute",

Vomit Reaction Trigger The trap's sensors notice a creature on the stairs north of the entrance to area D4; Effect The myriad mouths on the walls spew out a foul-smelling acidic slurry along the entire stairwell. The stairs in areas D3 become difficult terrain, and all creatures in area D3 must attempt a DC 34 Reflex saving throw. A creature that is fatigued by hunger takes a –2 circumstance penalty to this saving throw. The trap then rolls initiative. Critical Success The creature is unaffected. Success The creature takes 4d6 acid damage and is sickened 1. Failure The creature takes 8d6 acid damage, is sickened 2, and is knocked prone. Critical Failure The creature takes 16d6 acid damage, is sickened 3, is knocked prone, and then tumbles down the stairs. The fall ends once the creature reaches the next lowest landing (note that a creature falling at the lowest flight tumbles into the carrion pit at area D2, but can attempt to Grab an Edge as detailed in that room). A creature that falls down the steps takes an additional 4d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 32 basic Reflex save) from the tumble, regardless of the total distance traveled. --- Routine (1 action) On its turn, the trap Vomits as its action. As long as the Putrid Rise is active, the stairs in area D3 are difficult terrain. --- Reset The trap deactivates 1 round after no targets can be sensed, but resets immediately.",

At this point, the portal triggers as soon as such a creature looks into it. A character who just passes by and doesn't specifically avert their gaze must attempt a DC 11 flat check to not accidently glance into the portal, while a character who Searches this room automatically looks into it unless they specify otherwise. Effect The nightmare portal casts phantasmal calamity (heightened to 8th level, Will save DC 37), making reality appear to crumble away to reveal a vast cavern filled with bones through which immense wormlike creatures burrow as they endlessly eat away at the world. The trap then rolls initiative. --- Routine (2 actions) A vision of an immense lumbering figure with nothing but a circular mouth for a face lurches out of the portal. For each action, the nightmare portal casts phantasmal killer (heightened to 8th level, Will save DC 37), targeting a different creature both times. It can select targets in area E11, the secret alcove to the northeast, or up to 10 feet east from the door (although a closed door blocks it), choosing the closest two targets each round. The nightmare portal loses 1 action if it's broken and can thus only cast phantasmal killer once per round. --- Reset The nightmare portal resets 1 minute after it no longer detects targets.",

Prostrate Reaction (divine, emotion, fear, illusion, incapacitation, mental); Trigger A creature moves more than 10 feet into the room.

Critical Failure The creature is knocked prone and immobilized for 1 round. --- Routine (3 actions; divine, enchantment, mental) Ghostly images of chanting dwarves float through the room, drifting between the creatures in the chamber. As they float, they use their 3 actions to target up to three different creatures in the room, touching their brows and filling that person's head with overwhelming but entirely mental choirs exalting the glory of Torag. The haunt targets prone creatures before other creatures, and a single creature cannot be targeted more than once per round. A targeted creature must attempt a DC 25 Will save; prone creatures take a –2 penalty on this saving throw. Critical Success The creature is unaffected.

Raging Storm Reaction Trigger The PCs fail an attempt to Disable the tempest, or 10 minutes pass without any attempt to leave the area (whichever comes first); Effect Bolts of lightning lance down from above. If the PCs managed to succeed at a Survival check to prepare for the storm, their armies are protected and only one PC (determined randomly) is targeted by this bolt, otherwise all PCs and armies are targeted by bolts.

Success The PC is knocked prone and takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage. Failure The PC is hurled through the air, taking 8d6 bludgeoning damage and then falling 1d6×10 feet for appropriate falling damage, landing prone.

The trap then rolls initiative. --- Routine (2 actions) Noph frantically pecks and stomps on the console, using each action to press a random sigil. Roll 1d6 to determine which sigil Noph presses. Psychopomps are immune to the effects of these sigils. The area is flooded with holy light, dealing 3d12+19 positive damage to each creature in the area (DC 43 basic Reflex save). The area is flooded with unholy darkness, dealing 3d12+19 negative damage to each creature in the area (DC 43 basic Reflex save). The area is flooded with blue flames, dealing 3d10+19 fire damage to each creature in the area (DC 43 basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, a creature additionally takes 1d10 persistent fire damage. A comet streaks through the area, attacking the nearest creature to Noph with a comet Strike. Force tethers sprout from the floor, grasping at intruders. Each creature in the area is immobilized for 1 round unless they succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save. Ghostly blue mist surrounds each psychopomp in the area, healing them 3d8+19 HP and granting them concealment for 1 round. Ranged Single Action comet +33, Damage 3d12+19 bludgeoning",

The trap then rolls initiative. --- Routine (1 action) The performance continues to sow seeds of enmity, discord, and distrust on those in its area.

Success The target is frightened 1 for 2 rounds. Failure The target is frightened 2 for 1 minute and is certain the source of this fear is their fellow citizens, especially those from places other than their hometown. For 1 week the target suffers a –2 penalty to all Diplomacy skill checks against people from other Thuvian cities and regains the frightened 2 condition whenever they are in one of those cities. Critical Failure As failure, but the target becomes a carrier for The Enmity Cycle for the next week. The target is compelled to travel to a city other than where they were exposed and recite as many lines from the anbarit as they can recall. Those who hear or witness the performance are treated as if they had attended a performance of The Enmity Cycle , but the Will save DC is 23. --- Reset A new production of The Enmity Cycle must be arranged; this process usually takes at least 1 week.",

If the sphere would enter a creature's space, it stops moving in that creature's space, then attempts to counter the triggering magic effect (or alternately, the strongest magic effect on the creature), with a counteract modifier of +28. A counteracted magic item becomes a mundane item of its type for 10 minutes. If the target is a creature, or is a creature who's carrying the targeted item, the creature takes 10d6 force damage from this effect (DC 36 basic Fortitude save). The rogue sphere then rolls initiative. --- Routine (2 actions) The sphere uses its first action to fly 30 feet toward the closest creature currently under the effects of a spell, or it uses both actions to fly 60 feet toward the closest creature if none are within 30 feet. The rogue sphere attempts to enter the target's space. If a rogue sphere shares a creature's space, it uses an action to Magic Drift the target. If the target has no magical effects or carries no magic items, the result of its Fortitude save to resist the force damage caused by Magic Drift is increased by one degree of success. --- Reset The sphere ceases moving when no creature remains to trigger Magic Drift. It then dissipates after an hour spent with no targets within 60 feet",

Each non-storykin creature within 60 feet who can see the skull is subjected to an overwhelming feeling of being sucked into it, and must attempt a DC 40 Will save. Critical Success The creature is unaffected. Success The creature feels pain across its body, as if the skull's inhalation were pulling the skin from its bones. The creature becomes sickened 1 and takes 8d6 mental damage. Failure The creature is convinced that the skull just “breathed in” its skin, and it takes 16d6 mental damage. The overwhelming pain leaves the creature slowed 1 for 1 round as well. Critical Failure As failure, but 24d6 mental damage and the creature is stunned 3 from the pain. --- Reset 1 hour",

With her other action, she either Exudes Heat or makes Rocks Fall, alternating between the two each round. Exude Heat Single Action Zogototaru breathes fire across Guldrege. Even from a distance, this makes the area blisteringly hot, dealing 3d6 fire damage to all creatures (DC 22 basic Fortitude save). Rocks Fall Single Action Zogototaru's thrashing appears to crack the roof, dropping debris on a random creature in the area. This deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 22 basic Reflex save). Tremor Single Action Zogototaru's thrashing shakes the ground, knocking creatures prone in the area unless they succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save.",

All creatures in area H6 must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (sickened 2 on a critical failure). The haunt then rolls initiative. --- Routine (1 action; evocation, fire, occult) The smoking vision of the Sandpoint Devil appears to hover over the pit, its wings of fire flapping as its head lowers to exhale a 30-foot cone of fire into the room, targeting as many creatures as possible. Note that the geist can be targeted by this blast of fire as well, but remember that its resistance applies to the fire. All creatures in the area take 7d6 fire damage (DC 28 basic Reflex save). A creature that critically fails this saving throw is also frightened 1; this effect has the emotion, fear, and mental traits. --- Reset The haunt deactivates 1 minute after all creatures leave the area but resets immediately thereafter.",

Crimson vapor holds the faceless shape together, never coalescing into an identifiable form, but merely writhing through ever-changing images of torment and destruction. --- Stealth +38 (master) to notice that clouds of debris are coalescing into swirling, faceless shapes held together by rust-red fog and spectral, dripping clots of gore Disable DC 38 Occultism (master) to temporarily negate the psychic resonances around each fragment, causing the agglomeration to fall apart, or DC 33 Religion (expert) to temporarily interrupt Verex-That-Was's unholy power with divine energy from another source. If a boneburst takes 40 points of damage from a single source and it isn't destroyed, it is rendered dormant for 1 round. AC 33, Fort +30, Ref +28 Hardness 20 HP 90 (BT 45) Immunities critical hits, object immunities, precision damage Gathering Mist Reaction Trigger A living creature approaches within 50 feet of a dormant boneburst; Effect The boneburst awakens, roiling up from the ground, and rolls initiative. --- Routine (2 actions) An awakened boneburst occupies a 20- foot square; it is reduced to a 10-foot square when it reaches its BT. It can occupy the same space as other creatures, but not other bonebursts. On its initiative, the boneburst Flies up to 30 feet toward the nearest living creature as its first action. As its second action, the boneburst then coalesces around any living creature within its space, invisible shards of bone tearing at their flesh. Each living creature in its space takes 2d10+18 slashing damage and 1d10 spirit damage (DC 35 basic Reflex save). If no living creatures are within its space, the boneburst can use its second action to Fly up to 30 feet. --- Reset If the boneburst spends 5 consecutive rounds without coalescing around a living creature, it falls dormant, sinking back into the earth. After it falls dormant or is disabled, the boneburst gathers energy over the course of the next hour, after which it can be triggered again.",

Cherish and protect those friends and family who accept you as you are. Seek to better understand your hag mother and the gifts she gave you, for good or ill, or distance yourself from your heritage. Fear the day you hear the Call and worry you might not be able to resist—or perhaps you already fight to resist it every day. Others Probably... Assume you practice occult or primal magic, or that you participate in a coven. Worry that you might secretly be a monster, or become one, and turn on them.

Still others rise from occult rituals or other supernatural influences that impose a vampiric curse onto a mortal infant.

Dhampirs aren't immortal, but age far more slowly than most mortals, with a lifespan similar to that of an elf. Dhampirs have difficulty producing children of their own, and those few born to a dhampir are never dhampirs themselves. A dhampir generally resembles a member of their non-vampire parent's ancestry, but with a ghostly pallor and eyes so light it seems they have only pinpoint pupils and no iris.

Distance yourself from your heritage by trying to blend into society or even hunting undead. Take special precautions to avoid being exposed to “helpful” healing magic. Find yourself fascinated by the sight, smell, or taste of blood. Others Probably... Feel unsettled by your ghostly pallor and sharp teeth. Wonder about or even romanticize your origins and motivations. Find themselves strangely drawn to your grace, charm, and appearance.

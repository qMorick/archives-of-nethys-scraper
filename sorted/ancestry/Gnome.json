Long ago, early gnome ancestors emigrated from the First World, realm of the fey.

Very few gnomes survive this scourge, becoming deeply morose and wise survivors known as bleachlings. If you want a character with boundless enthusiasm and an alien, fey outlook on morality and life, you should play a gnome. You Might... Embrace learning and hop from one area of study to another without warning. Speak, think, and move quickly, and lose patience with those who can't keep up. Others Probably... Appreciate your enthusiasm and the energy with which you approach new situations. Struggle to understand your motivations or adapt to your rapid changes of direction.

Garundi span the nations along the southern shores of the Inner Sea. Keleshites trace their origins to the Keleshite Empire in the eastern deserts. Kellids live among the mountains and steppes of northern Avistan. Mwangi are spread across the vast continent of Garund. Shoanti make their homes in the harsh badlands of the Storval Plateau. Taldans occupy much of Avistan thanks to a fallen empire. Tians originally come from the far-off continent of Tian Xia. Ulfens reside in coastal towns of western Avistan. Varisians historically favored a nomadic life of roving caravans.

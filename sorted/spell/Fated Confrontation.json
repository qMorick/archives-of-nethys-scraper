This is a [teleportation](/Traits.aspx?ID=156) effect.\n\n You isolate the two targets for 1 round. During this time, fate refuses to allow either fated opponent to be affected by attacks or effects from a third party; a fated opponent could be affected by the other's [_meteor swarm_](/Spells.aspx?ID=191) or its own [_heal_](/Spells.aspx?ID=148) spell, but it would be entirely immune to a spell or Strike from a creature outside of the spells effects, as well including damage from a hazard or the environment. This doesn't apply to anything that was affecting the targets before you cast _fated confrontation_ (such as a spell with a duration or persistent damage the creature had before it was affected by _fated confrontation_).\n\n For the duration of the spell, either fated opponent can manipulate fate once on each of its turns. This allows it to either roll twice and take the higher result on an attack roll or skill check it makes against its fated opponent (a [fortune](/Traits.aspx?ID=76) effect), or force the fated opponent to roll twice on a saving throw against one of its abilities and take the lower result (a [misfortune](/Traits.aspx?ID=110) effect).\n\n This spell ends if either target becomes unable to act, or if they both agree to cease hostilities.",

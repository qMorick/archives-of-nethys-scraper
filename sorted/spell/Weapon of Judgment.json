The attack deals spirit damage instead if that would be more detrimental to the creature (as determined by the GM). No other statistics or attributes of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only.

The weapon doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The weapon can't make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons don't apply to this weapon.\n\n---\r\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d10.",

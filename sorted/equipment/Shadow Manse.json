The mansion's interior is well-appointed and dimly lit via wall sconces and fireplaces that emit pale, heatless flames. Each day at dusk, the mansion's dining room produces enough fine food and water to sustain the creatures in the manor at that time. Except for this nourishment, everything inside the manor is nearly impossible to break; even the flimsiest chairs and thinnest draperies have Hardness 20. The material inside the mansion vanishes if removed, but is replaced with the next activation.\n\n Although the mansion is easy for anyone to enter, only you and other creatures you designate when you activate the manor can leave it. Others find themselves entering some other part of the mansion when they leave through a door or window, rather than exiting. A creature that succeeds at a DC 30 [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) check when attempting to exit the mansion can leave it if they choose, as can anyone who [Forces Open](/Actions.aspx?ID=34) an exit with a successful DC 30 [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check; any opening they make in the mansion closes behind them.\n\n You can return the _shadow manse_ to its dollhouse form by twisting the front door handle and uttering a command (as a single action). Once deactivated, it can't be reactivated for 8 hours.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",

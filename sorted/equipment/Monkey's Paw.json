When you pick up the _monkey's paw_, the hand opens, revealing three withered fingers. The _monkey's paw_ grants you three wishes (with the effects of a success on the [_wish_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=125) ritual), curling one finger after every one. Once you pick up the _monkey's paw_, you cannot discard the hand until it returns to a clenched fist by granting its three wishes. Any attempts to discard the hand, even with the effects of a _wish_ ritual, are unsuccessful as the _monkey's paw_ reappears among your possessions within 1d4 hours; it doesn't work for any other creature in the intervening time. The hand returns even if another creature steals it from you. Once you make all three wishes, the _monkey's paw_ uses [_interplanar teleport_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1576) to travel to a random point in the multiverse.\n\n Whenever the _monkey's paw_ hears you utter a statement that sounds like a wish, even if you don't use the words “I wish,” it activates and grants a twisted, horrifying version of your wish, producing any effect within the possibility of _wish_ ritual, and potentially a greater effect at the GM's discretion.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",

It thrums intermittently with a beckoning vibration, drawing attention from and pulling at nearby creatures with a tangible sense of gravity. A chill hangs in the air around it. At a touch, the wisp vanishes, giving the point of contact a gangrenous color. If the partaker succeeds at the initial save, the wisp reappears somewhere on the same planet.\n\n---\n\n**Stage 1 (8 Days)** The first time you enter this stage from a given void fragment, you gain the effect of a [_potion of truespeech_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2954) for 3 days. The wisp grants you [telepathy](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=37) with a range of 30 feet. Also, you are under the effects of [_hidden mind_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1556), except that its status bonus is +1 and it [counteracts](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) with a bonus equal to your class DC – 9. The wisp grants you resistance to [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) damage equal to half your level. You also have access to the following activation.\n\n**Activate** <actions string=\"\" /> <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> or <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561), [teleportation](/Traits.aspx?ID=710)) **Frequency** once per hour;   **Effect** You teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. If you used 2 actions, you can teleport up to 60 feet.\n\n---\n\n**Stage 2 (24 Days)** You gain [imprecise](/Rules.aspx?ID=412) thoughtsense to half your telepathy's range, which increases to 60 feet. However, you have a tough time filtering the mental noise. If any creatures can be detected by your thoughtsense, you take a –1 penalty to Perception checks. When you arrive in a space after using the activation to teleport, you create a 10-foot emanation that works like [_strange geometry_](/Spells.aspx?ID=719)  for 1 round. This emanation can affect you.\n\n If you die at this stage or higher, your body implodes. Your soul reincarnates as an [aberration](/Traits.aspx?ID=1) of a level close to yours, which extrudes from the location of your implosion. Common forms include [jah-tohl](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2930), [gosreg](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2931), [quelaunt](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3159), [rhu-chalik](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2928), [shoggoth](/Monsters.aspx?ID=368), and [xoarian](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2929). This creature isn't you, but fleeting memories of your former existence remain with it. You can't be raised from the dead while this monster endures. The _void fragment_ reappears somewhere on the same planet.\n\n---\n\n**Stage 3 (32 Days)** Your telepathy range increases to 100 feet, and the wisp grants you resistance to [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) damage equal to your level. The mental noise increases the penalty to Perception to –2. Whenever you roll initiative, you become confused for up to 1d4 rounds.\n\n---\n\n**Stage 4** You die.\n\n---\n\n **Purging** You must find and slay a powerful [aberration](/Traits.aspx?ID=523) or a servant of such creatures the GM deems appropriate. The creature must be of your level or higher. Then, someone must cast a [_rest eternal_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=153) ritual on you and the dead being; you must be anointed with the same oils the ritual normally requires. If the ritual results in a success, it casts the slain creature into the void along with the _void fragment_ inside you, ending its effects on you.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",

Only a handful of mortals can truthfully claim to have seen a toshigami, let alone met one, though many popular fireside tales tell of virtuous souls receiving a toshigami's blessing to fight for a worthy cause. Such stories have a basis in fact; every so often, a toshigami gives a worthy mortal a flower from their ward, time-locked in perfect bloom and granted sapience. Such _toshigami blossoms_ are more sociable than their creators. Like toshigami, a blossom has a strong curiosity about the mortal world.

You and your allies can see through these blossoms. To all other creatures, creatures within the cloud of blossoms become [concealed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=62), and creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it. When you or an ally succeeds with a Strike against a creature in the blossoms, the Strike deals an additional 1d6 [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647) damage and an additional 1d6 [void](/Traits.aspx?ID=510) damage to living creatures, or an additional 1d6 [vitality](/Traits.aspx?ID=509) damage to [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=722).\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",

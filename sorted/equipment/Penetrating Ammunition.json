When you activate and shoot _penetrating ammunition_, the Strike takes the shape of a 60-foot line originating from you. Roll one attack roll and compare the result to the AC of each target in the line. The ammunition ignores up to 10 of a target's resistance, and it can penetrate walls up to 1 foot thick with Hardness 10 or less. Each target that takes damage from this ammunition also takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage.<br /> If your attack roll result is a natural 20, you improve your degree of success only against the first target in the line, but you can still score a critical hit on other targets if your result exceeds their AC by 10 or more. If you have access to your bow's critical specialization effect, _penetrating ammunition_ applies that effect only against a target in the last square of the line.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",

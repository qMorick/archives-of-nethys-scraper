Unlike other items created with advanced alchemy, the philosopher's stone remains potent for 1 month or until the alchemist creates a new one. This is the only way to create a philosopher's stone.\n\n At a glance, a philosopher's stone appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of natural rock.

The cavity is lined with a rare type of quicksilver that can transmute base metals into precious metals or create an elixir of rejuvenation. To use the quicksilver, you must be legendary in [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=37) and have the [Alchemical Crafting](/Feats.aspx?ID=5117) feat.

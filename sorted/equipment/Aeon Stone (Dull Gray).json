Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times.\n\n When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an _aeon stone_ with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.\n\n There are various types of _aeon stones_, each with a different shape, color, and magical effect. Each _aeon stone_ also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a [_wayfinder_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=470).\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 7\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nAeon Stone (Clear Spindle)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Core Rulebook](/Sources.aspx?ID=1) pg. 604 <sup>4.0</sup>\n\n**Price** 325 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou don’t need to eat or drink while this _aeon stone_ is invested by you.

 "text": "<title level=\"1\" right=\"Item 1+\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Aeon Stone Source Core Rulebook pg. 604 4.0 Usage worn --- Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to discover their secrets. Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times. When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an aeon stone with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again. There are various types of aeon stones , each with a different shape, color, and magical effect. Each aeon stone also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a wayfinder . <title level=\"2\" right=\"Item 7\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Aeon Stone (Clear Spindle) Source Core Rulebook pg. 604 4.0 Price 325 gp --- You don’t need to eat or drink while this aeon stone is invested by you. This aeon stone doesn’t function until it has been worn continuously for a week and invested each day therein. If it’s invested by someone else, this interval starts over. The resonant power allows you to cast air bubble as a primal innate spell once per day. <title level=\"2\" right=\"Item 1\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Aeon Stone (Dull Gray) Source Core Rulebook pg. 604 4.0 Price 9 gp --- A dull gray aeon stone has lost its special magical properties, sometimes as a result of overusing a tourmaline sphere or pale lavender ellipsoid aeon stone . It still orbits your head like any other aeon stone and can thus serve as a stylish, hands-free option for various spells that target an object, like continual flame . Dull gray aeon stones have no resonant power. <title level=\"2\" right=\"Item 6\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Aeon Stone (Gold Nodule) Source Core Rulebook pg. 604 4.0 Price 230 gp --- When a gold nodule aeon stone is created, its creator chooses a language they know to store within the crystal. When you invest the stone, you gain the ability to understand, speak, and write that language. The resonant power allows you to cast comprehend language as an occult innate spell once per day. <title level=\"2\" right=\"Item 19\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Aeon Stone (Lavender and Green Ellipsoid) Source Core Rulebook pg. 604 4.0 Price 30,000 gp --- This functions as a pale lavender ellipsoid aeon stone , but it casts an 8th-level dispel magic spell with a counteract modifier of +31. The resonant power allows you to cast detect magic and read aura as arcane innate spells at will. <title level=\"2\" right=\"Item 16\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Aeon Stone (Orange Prism) Source Core Rulebook pg. 604 4.0 Price 9,750 gp --- An orange prism aeon stone must be activated to provide a benefit. The resonant power grants you a +2 item bonus to Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion checks—whichever corresponds to the tradition of the last spell you enhanced with this aeon stone . Activate Single Action envision; Effect If your next action is to Cast a Spell, that spell’s level is 1 higher (maximum 10th level) for the purposes of counteracting and being counteracted. <title level=\"2\" right=\"Item 13\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Aeon Stone (Pale Lavender Ellipsoid) Source Core Rulebook pg. 604 4.0 Price 2,200 gp --- This aeon stone must be activated to provide a benefit. The resonant power allows you to cast the read aura cantrip as an arcane innate spell. Activate Reaction envision; Frequency once per day; Trigger A spell targets you; Effect The stone casts a 6th-level dispel magic spell in an attempt to counteract the triggering spell, with a counteract modifier of +22. This can be used only on spells that specifically target you—not area spells that don’t have targets. If it succeeds, it counteracts the spell for all targets if other creatures were targeted in addition to you. Each time you activate this aeon stone , attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a failure, the stone permanently turns into a dull gray aeon stone . <title level=\"2\" right=\"Item 12\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Aeon Stone (Pink Rhomboid) Source Core Rulebook pg. 604 4.0 Price 1,900 gp --- When you invest this stone, you gain 15 temporary Hit Points. If the stone’s effects are suppressed, you lose any of the temporary Hit Points remaining until it returns. The temporary Hit Points refresh during your daily preparations; they do not refresh if you re-invest the stone, or invest another pink rhomboid aeon stone , before then. The resonant power allows you to cast the stabilize cantrip as a divine innate spell. <title level=\"2\" right=\"Item 7\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Aeon Stone (Tourmaline Sphere) Source Core Rulebook pg. 604 4.0 Price 350 gp --- When you would die from the dying condition (typically at dying 4), this aeon stone automatically activates and reduces your dying value to 1 less than would normally kill you (typically to dying 3). The stone then permanently turns into a dull gray aeon stone . You can benefit from this ability only once per day, even if you have multiple such stones. The resonant power allows you to cast 1st-level heal as a divine innate spell once per day. <title level=\"2\" right=\"Item 12\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Aeon Stone (Black Pearl) Source World Guide pg. 63 2.0 PFS Note All characters of 10th level or higher who are from the High Seas have access to black pearl aeon stones Price 2,000 gp Usage worn --- This black pearl sparkles with light. The resonant power allows you to cast sending once per day. Activate Reaction envision; Trigger you are targeted by a mental effect; Effect You receive a +4 status bonus to your saving throw against the triggering effect. Whether or not your save is successful, the aeon stone attempts a counteract check at +30 to immediately reflect a copy of the effect back at the originator, targeting it using the creature’s own relevant statistics but controlling the effect as if you had cast it. Every time you activate this aeon stone, attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a failure, the stone shatters and loses its magical properties forever. <title level=\"2\" right=\"Item 5\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Aeon Stone (Agate Ellipsoid) Source PFS Guide pg. 121 PFS Note All characters affiliated with the Pathfinder Society have access to this item Price 130 gp Usage worn Access Member of the Pathfinder Society. --- This aeon stone allows you to cast 2nd-level augury as a divine innate spell once per day.

You have a limited sense of how many life forces are currently within 30 feet of the stone, which you can potentially use to determine when it's safe to call on the stone's power. At any time within the next hour after your body died, you can spend 1 minute concentrating in order to return to your body. As long as your body is still intact, you are no longer dead— you are restored to 1 HP with the doomed 3 and wounded 3 conditions. You can benefit from the effects of only one pale orange rhomboid aeon stone in a given day. The resonant power allows you to wait more than an hour to return to your body with the aeon stone ; as long as the wayfinder remains on the body, your body doesn't decay and you can return at any point. <title level=\"2\" right=\"Item 10\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Aeon Stone (Pearlescent Pyramid) Source PFS Guide pg. 121 PFS Note All characters affiliated with the Pathfinder Society have access to this item Price 900 gp Usage worn Access Member of the Pathfinder Society. --- While invested, this aeon stone grants the benefit of the ghost touch property rune to your weapons and unarmed attacks.

When a non-magical item in your possession with a value of 90 gp or less and a Bulk of 1 Bulk or less would become broken, this aeon stone automatically activates, preventing the item from breaking by restoring the item's current Hit Points to the item's maximum Hit Points.

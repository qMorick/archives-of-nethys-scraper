While this effect is active, creatures can't be [concealed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=4) from you due to living plants, such as small trees, vines, and grass. This vision also prevents them from [Hiding](/Actions.aspx?ID=62) or [Sneaking](/Actions.aspx?ID=63) past you using only living plants for concealment or cover. Other than the inability to use the cover to Hide or Sneak, this ability doesn't prevent plants from providing [cover](/Rules.aspx?ID=459) to creatures or blocking line of effect. It also doesn't allow you to see through dead plant matter, such as the wooden walls of a building, or thick plant matter, such as the walls of a dungeon built entirely inside an enormous living tree.

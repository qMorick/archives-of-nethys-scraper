However, you can attack only with the _fanged_ weapon and you don't have hands or the ability to hold items. For effects dependent on how many hands you are using to hold the item, such as the [two-hand](/Traits.aspx?ID=198) trait, you are holding the weapon in two hands. You can Dismiss this effect, and it ends automatically if you drop the _fanged_ weapon (whether or not of your own volition).\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 2\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nFanged\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Grand Bazaar](/Sources.aspx?ID=100) pg. 106\n\n**Price** 30 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 8\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nFanged (Greater)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Grand Bazaar](/Sources.aspx?ID=100) pg. 106\n\n**Price** 425 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn animal form, you gain [low-light vision](/Rules.aspx?ID=416) and a +5-foot item bonus to your Speed.\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 15\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nFanged (Major)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Grand Bazaar](/Sources.aspx?ID=100) pg. 106\n\n**Price** 6,000 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn animal form, you gain low-light vision, imprecise scent to a range of 30 feet, and a +10-foot item bonus to your Speed.",

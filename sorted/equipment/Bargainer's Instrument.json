The first to reach four successes wins, with each critical successes counting as two successes. If you play the bargainer’s instrument as part of your performance, it grants you a +2 item bonus to the Performance checks.\n\nAfter the contest, the conjured creature can choose to return to where it came from or remain where you conjured it. The loser must endeavor to complete the task by all reasonable means within 1 week. Failing to complete it is shameful but has no further consequences.

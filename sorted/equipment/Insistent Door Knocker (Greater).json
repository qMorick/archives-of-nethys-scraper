Placing the door knocker on the surface of a door (an Interact action) causes it to attach and remain in place. While in place, the door knocker whispers hints to you while you attempt to unlock the door, granting a +1 item bonus to [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) checks to Pick a Lock. Removing the door knocker from a surface requires you to use an Interact action.\n\n**Activate** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> command, Interact;  **Frequency** once per day;   **Effect** You place the door knocker against a wall, floor, or ceiling. The door knocker fuses in place and creates a usable door within the surface. Any creature can move through the door normally, as if the door had always been there. The door can penetrate up to 1 foot of material, so thick material, such as heavy stone walls, can cause this effect to fail, expending its use for the day. A thin layer of metal in a wall, floor, or ceiling also causes the effect to fail. You can use an Interact action to release the door knocker from the surface and return the surface to its previous shape.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 6\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nInsistent Door Knocker\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Character Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=12) pg. 72 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\n**Price** 225 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** 1\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 11\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nInsistent Door Knocker (Greater)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Character Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=12) pg. 72 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\n**Price** 1,250 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** 1\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe item bonus is +2, and the door knocker can penetrate up to 5 feet of material when activated.\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 17\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nInsistent Door Knocker (Major)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Character Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=12) pg. 72 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\n**Price** 13,500 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** 1\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe item bonus is +3, and the door knocker can penetrate up to 10 feet of material when activated.",

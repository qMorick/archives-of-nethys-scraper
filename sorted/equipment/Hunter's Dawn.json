You can use _Hunter's Dawn_ with a mundane dart or javelin like you would use a bow with an arrow; when you do so, the range of the dart or javelin is doubled, and the dart or javelin uses _Hunter's Dawn_ to determine its attack modifier and damage dice.\n\n**Activate** <actions string=\"Single Action to Three Actions\" /> Interact;     **Effect** You swing _Hunter's Dawn_ and launch a magically conjured javelin at a target within 60 feet, making a ranged Strike. The javelin has the statistics of a javelin but gains the magical properties of _Hunter's Dawn_ and disappears immediately after hitting or missing its target. On a successful hit, you deal damage (3d6 piercing, due to the atlatl's _greater striking_ rune, plus your Strength modifier); in addition, a gazelle leaps from the hit target to one or more targets within 20 feet of the first, dealing 2d6 piercing damage plus your Strength modifier.

You can choose one of the following shapes for the fire to take: a 10-foot square, a 20-foot line, or a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the affected squares take 6d6 fire damage (DC 46 basic Reflex save).\r\n\r\n**Destruction** _Hunter's Dawn_ can be destroyed only by placing it on the funeral pyre of a dead god.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",

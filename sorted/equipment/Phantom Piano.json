If you accept, the piano asks only that you practice with it and perform for increasingly refined and august audiences, requiring a successful [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) check appropriate to your proficiency level. The piano sets no strict timeline, but at the GM's discretion, if you go too long without making progress, the piano can cease cooperating with you until it's satisfied with your dedication once again.\n\n While you keep up your end of the bargain, the piano grants you a +2 item bonus to Performance checks made with it.

The shield has resistance 10 against the damage type corresponding to the dragon breath of the dragon whose hide was used in its creation (for example, a _dragonslayer's shield_ made with the hide of a diabolic dragon would grant resistance to fire); this applies after reducing the damage for Hardness, so when you use Shield Block, the dragonslayer's shield takes 18 less damage from attacks of that damage type.

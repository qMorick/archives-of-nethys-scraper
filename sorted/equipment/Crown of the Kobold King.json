Yet Gristogar wasn't equal to his own ambitions, and before he could complete the _Crown of Toil_, his cult died out and he ended his own life. For centuries, the incomplete crown lay dormant, but over that time, fragments of Gristogar's soul infused it—not enough to transform it into a truly intelligent item, but enough to give it a rudimentary need and desire to be completed.\n\n When the Kobold King Merlokrep discovered the discarded crown and placed it upon his head, the crown at last had agency— if not in a hale and hearty dwarf, at least in the frame of a powerful and ambitious kobold. Just as the crown began influencing Merlokrep, so too did the Kobold King's personality influence the crown.

Once linked, any creature can use a [teleportation](/Traits.aspx?ID=156) effect to target the _witchwyrd beacon_ directly, regardless of line of sight. You can [_dimension door_](/Spells.aspx?ID=69) or [_gate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=130) to the beacon as if you could see its location, and if you travel to it via an effect like [_plane shift_](/Spells.aspx?ID=222), the beacon eliminates the imprecision of the spell. The beacon doesn't change the range of effects, only their accuracy. Once the beacon is used in this manner, it loses its link and must be reactivated again to grant this benefit to attuned creatures.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",

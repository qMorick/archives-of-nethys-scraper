A spike launcher is a _+1 striking weapon_. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals 1d8 piercing damage. It has the [backstabber](/Traits.aspx?ID=172), [fatal aim d12](/Traits.aspx?ID=404), and [kickback](/Traits.aspx?ID=409) traits with a [range increment](/Traits.aspx?ID=248) of 120 feet and [reload 2](/Traits.aspx?ID=254).

Make a Strike with the _spike launcher_ against each creature in the area. These attacks count toward the your multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after you make all of your attacks. On a success, the spike causes the creature to take a –5-foot status penalty to their Speed. On a critical success, the creature becomes [immobilized](/Conditions.aspx?ID=24) instead. In either case, the creature, or an adjacent creature, can use an Interact action to remove the spike and end the penalty or immobilized condition.\n\n**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the tail of a manticore.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",

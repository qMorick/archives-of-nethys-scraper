Each crown is fashioned to represent the instinct it's tied to, such as a wolf's head for an [animal instinct](/Instincts.aspx?ID=1) crown or a simple helmet with Jotun runes for a [giant instinct](/Instincts.aspx?ID=4) crown. When worn, the crown allows you to tap further into your instincts, granting you even greater benefits if the crown's essence matches your instinct. You must be able to [Rage](/Actions.aspx?ID=3) to use the crown's activations.\n\n**Activate** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561)) **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You roll initiative; **Requirements** You have [Quick-Tempered](/Actions.aspx?ID=2803) and meet its requirements;; **Effect** You use Quick-Tempered and gain 10 additional temporary Hit Points from your Rage.\n\n**Activate** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561), [rage](/Traits.aspx?ID=680)) **Frequency** once per day;  **Requirements** You’re raging, and the crown’s instinct matches your barbarian instinct; **Effect** You draw upon your instinct to gain a boon, as follows. \n\n_Animal:_ Your bestial instincts take over, granting you greater ferocity. You can Stride as part of the activation, and you gain 10 additional temporary Hit Points from your rage. Until the end of your rage, you deal 3 additional damage with your animal’s unarmed attacks, and those unarmed attacks gain the [deadly](/Traits.aspx?ID=570) d8 trait. \n\n_Dragon:_ The might of dragons surrounds you in the form of dancing flames, poisonous wisps, or another appropriate manifestation. Until the end of your rage, adjacent creatures that hit you with a melee attack, as well as creatures that touch you or hit you with an unarmed attack, take 2d6 damage each time they do. The damage type is that of your instinct’s dragon breath. \n\n_Fury:_ Your boundless fury allows you push past your natural limits, moving with unmatched speed. You become [quickened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=89) until the end of your rage. You can use your extra action only to [Stride](/Actions.aspx?ID=2305) or [Strike](/Actions.aspx?ID=2306). \n\n_Giant:_ If you have the space to do so and aren’t already, you become Large. Your equipment grows with you but returns to its natural size if removed. Increase your reach by 5 feet (or by 10 feet if you were Tiny). You deal 2 additional damage when using your larger weapon. Also, when you Stride along the ground, you can shatter the earth with your footfalls, and any squares you move through become [difficult terrain](/Rules.aspx?ID=2366). You ignore the difficult terrain you create. The ground reverts to normal when your rage ends. \n\n_Spirit:_ You take on the partial form of a spirit, becoming somewhat incorporeal. Your raging resistance applies to all physical damage and poison damage, although you halve this resistance against magical attacks. \n\n_Superstition:_ Your body fights off the effects of magic with even greater effect. Until the end of your rage, when you attempt a saving throw against magic, roll twice and take the higher result. This is a [fortune](/Traits.aspx?ID=612) effect. Also, your raging resistance applies to all magic traditions while you rage.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",

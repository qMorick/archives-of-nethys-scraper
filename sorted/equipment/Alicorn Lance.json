In addition to its normal damage, it deals 1 spirit damage on successful attacks. You can make the lance glow like a torch or suppress its light by using an action, which has the concentrate trait. Activate Two Actions (magical, manipulate) Frequency once per hour; Effect You evoke the spirit of the unicorn that donated the alicorn lance's horn, which you ride in a shining charge. Move up to twice your Speed and make a Strike with the alicorn lance ; you gain the effects of the lance's jousting trait on this Strike. If you were already mounted when you Activate the horn, the unicorn spirit takes shape around your steed, granting it a +10–foot status bonus to its Speed for the charge.

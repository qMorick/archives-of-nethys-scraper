While uncomfortable to wear, the crown beguiles those within the wearer's presence. Creatures within 30 feet of you automatically improve their attitude toward you by one step (up to [friendly](/Conditions.aspx?ID=18)). This doesn't prevent [hostile](/Conditions.aspx?ID=23) creatures from attacking you, but it might give you a chance to talk to them before they strike. The dazzling nature of the crown makes it hard for you to read the intentions of others, and you take a –4 status penalty to your Perception DC when someone uses [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) against you. When you invest the crown, you either increase your Charisma modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever is higher.\n\n**Activate** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561)) **Frequency** once per round;   **Effect** You're the subject of the [_sanctuary_](/Spells.aspx?ID=266) spell until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Activate** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561)) **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** A creature succeeds at an attack roll against you;  **Effect** The creature must succeed at a DC 41 Will save or the attack roll becomes a failure and the target is friendly to you until the end of its turn.

It's a distinct type of martial firearm made from the fangs and spinneret of a Large spider. It deals 1d10 poison damage with a [range increment](/Traits.aspx?ID=248) of 30 feet and [reload 1](/Traits.aspx?ID=254). On a critical hit, the venom clings to the target and they take [persistent poison damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) equal to 1d4 + the number of weapon damage dice. A spider gun does not add critical specialization effects. The gun can be activated to fire webbing that hampers other creatures.\n\n**Activate** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> Interact ([conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33), [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)) **Frequency** once per round;   **Effect** You fire a mass of webbing at a square within 30 feet. That square becomes covered in webbing for 1 minute. A square covered with the webbing from a _spider gun_ can be cleared by a single attack or effect that deals at least 5 slashing damage or 1 fire damage. A square has AC 5, and it automatically fails its saving throws. The first time each turn a creature in the webbing begins to use a move action or enters the webbing during a move action, it must attempt an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check or Reflex save against DC 20. On a success, it moves normally through the webbing and clears away the webbing from any squares it enters this turn. On a failure, it treats squares of webbing as difficult terrain this turn, and on a critical failure, it's [immobilized](/Conditions.aspx?ID=24) for 1 round or until it [Escapes](/Actions.aspx?ID=79) (DC 20) or destroys the webbing.\n\n**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials for the _spider gun_ must include the fangs and spinneret of a giant spider or other Large spider.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 6\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nSpider Gun\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Guns &amp; Gears](/Sources.aspx?ID=98) pg. 155 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\n**Price** 250 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** 2\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 9\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nSpider Gun (Greater)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Guns &amp; Gears](/Sources.aspx?ID=98) pg. 155 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\n**Price** 1,400 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** 2\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe gun's webbing requires at least 15 slashing damage or 5 fire damage to clear away and the DC is 25.\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 15\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nSpider Gun (Major)\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Guns &amp; Gears](/Sources.aspx?ID=98) pg. 155 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\n**Price** 6,500 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Bulk** 2\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA _major spider gun_ is a _+2 greater striking weapon_.

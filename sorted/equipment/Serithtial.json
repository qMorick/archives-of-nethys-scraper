She is an intelligent _+4 [major striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [holy](/Equipment.aspx?ID=299) [bastard sword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=15)_. Although the sword is made of steel, Serithtial is also treated as [cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375) and [silver](/Equipment.aspx?ID=379), allowing her to deal more damage to certain supernatural creatures. She glows as bright as a [torch](/Equipment.aspx?ID=60), but you or _Serithtial_ can suppress or resume this glow as a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait. In addition, Strikes with _Serithtial_ deal an additional 2d6 damage against creatures that are worshippers of [Zon-Kuthon](/Deities.aspx?ID=20). While wielding _Serithtial_, against effects created by followers of Zon-Kuthon you gain the benefit of [_unfettered movement_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1732), a +4 status bonus to saves against [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) and [void](/Traits.aspx?ID=510) effects, void resistance 10, and suppress the [doomed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=9) condition.\n\n _Serithtial_ was forged as a bastard sword, and she reverts to this shape when no one wields her, but she can also detect what sort of blade her current wielder prefers and transform into it (choosing from [dagger](/Weapons.aspx?ID=3), [shortsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=43), [longsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=31), [scimitar](/Weapons.aspx?ID=38), [falchion](/Weapons.aspx?ID=18), [greatsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=24), [rapier](/Weapons.aspx?ID=36), or bastard sword) using an action, which she does when first held. The wielder can empathically tell Serithtial to transform at any time by using a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait, after which Serithtial uses an action to transform.\n\n Serithtial is willing to work with almost any partner as long as they are dedicated to defeating the great wyrm Kazavon and the forces of Zon-Kuthon. If you ignore those threats and pursue your own agenda instead, before long _Serithtial_ attempts to seize control of your body (DC 45 Will save to resist her control), though she typically remains in control for only long enough to find a more worthy partner. You can attempt a new Will save each day to retake control of your body.\n\n**Activate—Grace of the Inheritor** <actions string=\"\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32)) **Frequency** once per hour;   **Effect** _Serithtial_ spends the appropriate number of actions and casts a 9th-rank [_heal_](/Spells.aspx?ID=148) or [_ring of truth_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1656) spell (DC 45 for either of the two spells).\r\n\r\n**Destruction** If Kazavon or a great wyrm shadow dragon who is a worshipper of Zon-Kuthon uses its dragon breath on _Serithtial_ while she is unattended, the sword melts into a pool of mundane iron.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",

However, while wearing _ouroboros buckles_, the unfathomable concept of infinity pulls at your mind, and each time you awaken, you'd swear the armor hissed into your ear while you were asleep. The hissing suggested secret wisdom to you in [Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), though you only ever remember it vaguely, like a fading dream.\n\n**Activate** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561), [manipulate](/Traits.aspx?ID=645)) **Frequency** once per day;   **Effect** You call forth the cursed regenerative blood of an [ouroboros](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1256) to recover from your wounds. You gain [regeneration 15](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=26) for 1 minute; [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72) damage deactivates this regeneration. Each time you regain Hit Points from this regeneration, if you're in your normal form, you collapse into a large swarm of Tiny snakes.

You have an AC of 16 + your level and ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction. Also, you gain resistance 5 to physical damage and weakness 5 to area damage and [splash](/Traits.aspx?ID=150) damage. You can use none of your normal Strikes. Instead, you can use Swarming Bites, a single action that deals 4d4 piercing damage plus 2d6 poison damage to creatures in your space with a DC 41 [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save.\n\n If you're in this battle form and are already at full HP when your regeneration occurs, the snakes instantaneously slither together, and you transform into your original form.\n\n**Activate** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561)) **Frequency** once per minute; **Trigger** A foe within 15 feet hits you with a Strike that deals slashing or piercing damage;  **Effect** Your _ouroboros buckles_ spray acidic blood in a 15-foot cone toward the foe, dealing 5d6 acid damage with a DC 41 [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",

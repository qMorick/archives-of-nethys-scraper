If the _horn of the aoyin's_ owner doesn't use the instrument's activation on sapient creatures at least once a day, the _horn of the aoyin_ activates at some point of its own choosing on the owner, and the owner critically fails with no saving throw.\n\n**Activate** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> Interact ([auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) **Frequency** once per hour;  **Requirements** You're trained in [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12); **Effect** You blow the horn, creating a low growling sound.

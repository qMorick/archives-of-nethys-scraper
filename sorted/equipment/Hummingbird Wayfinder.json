It serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society and as a status symbol among adventurers of any stripe. A _wayfinder_ functions as a compass.\n\n An indentation in the middle of the _wayfinder_ can hold a single _aeon stone_. Placing an _aeon stone_ in this indentation provides you all the benefits of having the _aeon stone_ orbiting your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. You invest a _wayfinder_ and the _aeon stone_ within it simultaneously, and they count as only one item toward your investiture limit. An invested _aeon stone_ slotted in a _wayfinder_ also grants its resonant power.\n\n If you have more than one _wayfinder_ with an invested _aeon stone_ on your person at a given time, destructive interference from their resonance prevents you from gaining benefits from any of them. You can still benefit from additional _aeon stones_ orbiting your head, just not in _wayfinders_.\n\n**Activate** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> command;     **Effect** The _wayfinder_ is targeted by a 1st-level [_light_](/Spells.aspx?ID=171) spell.\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 2\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nArchaic Wayfinder\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Evocation\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=65\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Invested\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=98\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Magical\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=103\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [World Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=6) pg. 17 <sup>2.0</sup>\r\n\r\n_[**PFS Note**](/pathfinder-society) All characters have access to the archaic wayfinder_\r\n\r\n**Price** 30 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Usage** held in 1 hand\n\n</row>\n\n<row gap=\"tiny\"><row>**Activate**</row><actions string=\"\" /><row>Cast a Spell</row></row>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAn _archaic wayfinder_ functions as a compass and acts as a repository for one cantrip cast into it. To fill an _archaic wayfinder_, a spellcaster casts the chosen cantrip into the empty device, providing any necessary cost; the spell cannot be one that is normally cast as a free action or reaction. Activating an _archaic wayfinder_ is the same as the casting for the relevant spell. Once it has been activated, it becomes empty again. An _archaic wayfinder_ can hold an aeon stone and activate its resonant power. An _archaic wayfinder_ counts against the limit of one _wayfinder_ with a slotted resonant _[aeon stone](/Equipment.aspx?ID=407)_.\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 4\"\r\npfs=\"Limited\"\r\n>\r\nWayfinder of Rescue\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Evocation\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=65\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Invested\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=98\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Magical\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=103\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [PFS Scenario #1-03: Escaping the Grave](/Sources.aspx?ID=9) pg. 42\n\n**Price** 80 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Usage** worn\n\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs a standard _wayfinder_, but once per day you can activate it to cast _[heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)_ on a creature other than yourself, using either the one-action or two-action version of _[heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)_ as a 1st-level spell.\r\n\r\n<title\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nright=\"Item 6\"\r\npfs=\"Standard\"\r\n>\r\nBi-Resonant Wayfinder\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Evocation\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=65\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Illusion\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=92\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Invested\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=98\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Magical\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=103\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Character Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=12) pg. 110 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\n**Price** 200 gp\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Usage** worn\n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Access** A character who is a member of the Pathfinder Society has access to this option.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA _bi-resonant wayfinder_ is inlaid with intricate platinum wires in a complex array of conduits for magical energy.

 "text": "<title level=\"1\" right=\"Item 2+\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Wayfinder Source Core Rulebook pg. 617 4.0 --- This compact compass repurposes ancient technology to draw fantastic powers from the mysterious magical items called aeon stones . It serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society and as a status symbol among adventurers of any stripe. <title level=\"2\" right=\"Item 2\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Wayfinder Source Core Rulebook pg. 617 4.0 PFS Note All Pathfinders have access. Price 28 gp Usage worn --- This compact compass repurposes ancient technology to draw fantastic powers from the mysterious magical items called aeon stones . It serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society and as a status symbol among adventurers of any stripe. A wayfinder functions as a compass. An indentation in the middle of the wayfinder can hold a single aeon stone . Placing an aeon stone in this indentation provides you all the benefits of having the aeon stone orbiting your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. You invest a wayfinder and the aeon stone within it simultaneously, and they count as only one item toward your investiture limit. An invested aeon stone slotted in a wayfinder also grants its resonant power. If you have more than one wayfinder with an invested aeon stone on your person at a given time, destructive interference from their resonance prevents you from gaining benefits from any of them. You can still benefit from additional aeon stones orbiting your head, just not in wayfinders . Activate Single Action command; Effect The wayfinder is targeted by a 1st-level light spell. <title level=\"2\" right=\"Item 2\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Archaic Wayfinder Source World Guide pg. 17 2.0 PFS Note All characters have access to the archaic wayfinder Price 30 gp Usage held in 1 hand Activate Cast a Spell --- An archaic wayfinder functions as a compass and acts as a repository for one cantrip cast into it. To fill an archaic wayfinder , a spellcaster casts the chosen cantrip into the empty device, providing any necessary cost; the spell cannot be one that is normally cast as a free action or reaction. Activating an archaic wayfinder is the same as the casting for the relevant spell. Once it has been activated, it becomes empty again. An archaic wayfinder can hold an aeon stone and activate its resonant power. An archaic wayfinder counts against the limit of one wayfinder with a slotted resonant aeon stone . <title level=\"2\" right=\"Item 4\" pfs=\"Limited\" > Wayfinder of Rescue Source PFS Scenario #1-03: Escaping the Grave pg. 42 Price 80 gp Usage worn --- As a standard wayfinder , but once per day you can activate it to cast heal on a creature other than yourself, using either the one-action or two-action version of heal as a 1st-level spell. <title level=\"2\" right=\"Item 6\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Bi-Resonant Wayfinder Source Character Guide pg. 110 2.0 Price 200 gp Usage worn Access A character who is a member of the Pathfinder Society has access to this option. --- A bi-resonant wayfinder is inlaid with intricate platinum wires in a complex array of conduits for magical energy. These conduits control the resonant interference of aeon stones . A bi-resonant wayfinder works just like a regular wayfinder except it has two aeon stone slots, and the aeon stones in both slots grant their resonant powers without interfering with each other. The bi-resonant wayfinder and the two aeon stones count as two items toward your investiture limit. <title level=\"2\" right=\"Item 4\" pfs=\"Standard\" > Shining Wayfinder Source Character Guide pg. 111 2.0 Price 100 gp Usage worn Access A character who is a member of the Pathfinder Society has access to this option. --- A shining wayfinder is a polished silver compass blessed by the power of benevolent deities.

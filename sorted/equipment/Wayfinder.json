You invest a wayfinder and the aeon stone within it simultaneously, and they count as only one item toward your investiture limit. An invested _aeon stone_ slotted in a wayfinder also grants its resonant power.<br /> If you have more than one wayfinder with an invested _aeon stone_ on your person at a given time, destructive interference from their resonance prevents you from gaining benefits from any of them.

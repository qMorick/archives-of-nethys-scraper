The constellation sheds dim light and remains visible even if the creature hides, aiding in locating it. Furthermore, while the constellation lasts, if you Cast a Spell that has a range and that spell would affect only the marked creature, the spell's range is increased by 30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if the spell normally has a range of touch, you extend its range to 30 feet. Each time you use this benefit, one of the stars above the creature's head winks out; when all three have winked out or after 1 minute has passed, the effect ends.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",

The shadows form an umbral double that resembles you in every way except for its fiery red eyes and the expression of wicked delight on its face. The double occupies the same space as you and attempts to intercept any attacks aimed at you. A creature must succeed at a DC 11 flat check when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect; on a failure, they hit the shadowy double instead of you. The effect lasts for 1 minute or until the double is hit, whichever comes first. Once the double is hit, it's destroyed. As long as the double exists, you don't gain _the Shadewither Key's_ item bonus to Stealth checks.\r\n\r\n**Destruction** _The Shadewither Key's_ magic can be destroyed by exposing the artifact to uncontained teleportation energies. If touched to an unlinked or malfunctioning _aiudara_, _the Shadewither Key_ causes the gate to connect to a new counterpart. If this happens, the key's magic leaves it, rendering the item useless.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",

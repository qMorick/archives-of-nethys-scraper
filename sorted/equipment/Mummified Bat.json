When activated, the affixed weapon detects vibrations around you and guides your perception. For 1 minute, you don't need to succeed at a flat check to target [concealed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=4) creatures. You're not [off-guard](/Conditions.aspx?ID=58) to creatures that are hidden from you (unless you're off-guard to them for reasons other than the hidden condition), and you need only a successful DC 5 flat check to target a [hidden](/Conditions.aspx?ID=22) creature. While you're adjacent to an undetected creature of your level or lower, it's instead only hidden from you. If you have the [Blind-Fight](/Feats.aspx?ID=388) feat, you gain imprecise<br /> echolocation with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. This makes creatures that would be undetected by you because you can't see them hidden instead.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",

Since then, individual pieces have turned up throughout the multiverse. When you pick up a _shot of the First Vault_, it immediately reshapes itself to function with any ranged weapon and establishes you as its owner until another creature picks it up. As its owner, you can use the shot's single-action activation after shooting it.\n\n Instead of rolling weapon damage dice, a _shot of the First Vault_ deals 25 damage plus any bonuses or additional damage as if 25 were the result of the weapon's damage dice; the damage type matches that normally dealt by the weapon. Upon damaging a creature, the _shot of the First Vault_ shatters, and the fragments ricochet to hit any other enemies within 30 feet, making attack rolls with the same attack bonus. The shattered fragments remain lodged in the creatures they damage; the creatures are [clumsy 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=61) while the fragments remain in place. A total of 3 Interact actions are required to remove the fragments from yourself or an adjacent creature; alternatively, a single action and a successful DC 30 [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) check can be used. A critical failure on this Medicine check deals 10 [persistent bleed damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) to the creature with the embedded fragment.\n\n**Activate—Reload Order** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32))   **Requirements** The shot is loaded in your ranged weapon, or at hand if your ranged weapon has a reload of 0; **Effect** You recall the _shot of the First Vault_, which automatically reloads itself into your weapon. If the shot had fragmented, the fragments violently dislodge themselves, dealing 15 persistent bleed damage to each creature in which they were embedded. The fragments then unite to re-form the _shot of the First Vault_, which automatically reloads itself into your weapon.\n\n**Activate—Vault Deposit** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([manipulate](/Traits.aspx?ID=104))    **Effect** You line up a perfectly aimed attack directly toward the First Vault. You Strike a creature, then the _shot of the First Vault_ attempts to bring your target with it as it returns to the First Vault. Unless your attack roll is a critical failure, the creature must attempt a DC 45 Reflex save; this effect has the [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93) trait. Regardless, the _shot of the First Vault_ returns to the First Vault.\r\n\r\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.<br />\r\n**Success** The creature is [moved](/Rules.aspx?ID=451) 1d20x50 feet in the direction you fired. If this causes it to hit a solid object, it takes 50 bludgeoning damage.<br />\r\n**Failure** The creature is transported to a random location on the plane of [Axis](/Planes.aspx?ID=14).<br />\r\n**Critical Failure** The creature is transported to the First Vault. Unless it is capable of eluding Abadar's precautions, it is likely unable to escape the Vault on its own.\r\n\r\n**Destruction** If 10 _shots of the First Vault_ are all fired at the same group of [keketar](/Monsters.aspx?ID=338) or [izfiitar](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1020) proteans within 1 minute of each other, each shot was a hit, and the shots are then recalled, the shots collide as they attempt to re-form and crumble to dust.\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n</column>",

This blessing manifests as the ability to heal wounds and remove harmful conditions, and exists independent of any worship. You might offer gratitude daily to the deity whose power you wield, or you might carry these blessings reluctantly, seeking to avoid responsibility or even openly acting to defy the deity's influence on you. You might wear the robes of the deity's order, or you might give little thought and even less reverence to the source of your powers. However you feel about these potent gifts, there can be no doubt that you wield a special power. Benevolent deities are most likely to empower a blessed one. However, any deity can grant such a blessing, as long as they're capable of granting a healing divine font to their clerics. This means such deities as Lamashtu might grant the blessed one's powers for their own purposes. Despite this possibility, it's quite uncommon for deities of cruelty, death, and destruction to grant the power of rejuvenation. When this does occur, the deity usually has a malicious intent behind the gift. Ultimately, you decide how you will use this gift.

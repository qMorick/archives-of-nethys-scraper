Multiclass Barbarian Characters The barbarian archetype is a great choice for characters who emphasize Strength and melee attacks more than usual for their class, as long as they can handle Rage's spellcasting restriction. It's especially good for characters looking to add more damage. Alchemist barbarians can enhance themselves with potent mutagens before releasing their fury. Champion barbarians might enter a zealous rage when their deity is offended and diplomacy is no longer an option. Druid barbarians transform into mighty beasts and monsters before entering a rage. Monk barbarians can use the enhanced emotional state of rage to flow with their stance. Rogue barbarians are ruffians who thrive in a scrap and are happy to let their anger take control. Spellcaster barbarians might wait until they're out of better options, using rage as a last resort. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6191\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6192\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6193\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6194\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6195\" />",

By knowing how to fight effectively with whatever is at hand, you ensure that you're never caught unarmed, and you often get the drop on opponents who mistakenly think they've caught you unprepared. Whether you're smashing someone over the head with a barstool, tossing a mug of ale in their face to blind them, or stabbing your foes with a broken bottle, you can find weapons anywhere and employ them creatively whenever a brawl breaks out. Because you fight with disposable weapons, you don't need handle them with care as other warriors do, and you can break them when needed to win a fight without feeling any regrets later.\n\n **Improvised Weapon Ideas**: Use these for inspiration. **Cavern**: broken stalagmite, large mushroom, old bones; **Docks**: barrel, crate, hook; **Forest**: branch, needles, or thorns; **Market**: box, fruit, scale, sign; **Courtroom or Study**: gavel, goblet, quill, lectern; **Tavern**: bottle, mug, serving tray, stool\n\n **GM Advice**: For a GM setting damage, typically a one-handed improvised weapon's damage is 1d4, 1d6, or 1d8; one that needs two hands is 1d8, 1d10, or occasionally 1d12, and an extremely ineffective one might deal 1 damage. Improvised weapons typically have zero, one, or two traits, and often have the nonlethal trait. Agile improvised weapons usually have a smaller die size. It's extremely rare for an improvised weapon to deal more than one die of damage, but powerful magical objects might. Improvised weapons should be fun and don't last long, so feel free to experiment!\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Archetypes/Archetype_Weapon_Improviser.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6440\" />\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6441\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6442\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6443\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6444\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6445\"\n\n/>",

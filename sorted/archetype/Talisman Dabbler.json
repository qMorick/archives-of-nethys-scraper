But magic is so much more than that—it's thought, will, and action, and with the right talismans, you can make even the cut of a sword a deeply magical act. This all hinges on the small magical talismans you affix to your gear. You know how to make and use the perfect talisman for any job. The utility of talismans seems endless. They can help swords to swing harder, shields to block better, grant a burst of speed in a desperate situation, and even save one from a lethal fall. This all excites you, but no more than exploring just how far you can push your talent. What are the true limits of these baubles? You've heard rumors and tales of great dabblers like yourself mastering the art of creating and affixing fantastical magical memorabilia. Some say that these great sages have found a way to affix multiple talismans to a single object, circumventing the most fundamental limitation of the art. Whether you were formally trained or picked up the skill as a hobby, your talent is undeniable, and the usefulness of talismans is apparent.

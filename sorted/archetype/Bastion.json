In your experience, the best defense is a good, solid shield between you and your enemies. You've focused your training on how best to use a shield to protect yourself and those around you. Darting around in search of cover isn't necessary when you carry your cover with you. With a shield in your hand, you are akin to a mobile fortress. You repel assaults and stand strong against the tide of enemies, secure in the knowledge that you have your most trusted companion at your side: your shield. This long-lasting fighting style has existed for ages due to its practicality and propensity for survival among its practitioners. While some prefer the nimbleness of a free hand or the power of a larger weapon, a bastion knows that surviving a little bit longer is worth more than a quicker or stronger attack.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Archetypes/Archetype_Bastion.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<title level=\"3\">Additional Feats</title>\r\n\r\nThis archetype has some feats at a level other than their original level.\r\nSuch feats are marked with a \\*.\r\n\r\n[Click here for the full rules on Additional Feats](/Rules.aspx?ID=1432).\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6262\" />\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3622\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 4*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6263\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-1087\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 4*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-1088\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 6*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6264\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4793\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 6*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4803\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 8*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4807\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 8*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6265\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4816\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 10*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4828\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 12*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6266\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4849\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 18*\"\r\n\r\n/>",

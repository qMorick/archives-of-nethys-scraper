Multiclass Investigator Characters The investigator archetype is a good choice for a character who wants deeper investigations or to plan out their turns in advance; it's a particularly good match for Intelligence-based characters like alchemists, witches, and wizards. Alchemist investigators double down on science and alchemy to better search for clues. Champion investigators can Devise a Stratagem to decide the optimal time to switch from defense to offense. Fighter investigators are constantly searching for optimal stratagems in the heat of battle. Ranger investigators can hunt down their prey in the deepest jungle and the busiest street corner. Spellcaster investigators can use magic and practical skills in pursuit of their lead. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6204\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6205\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6206\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6207\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6208\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6209\" />",

Multiclass Monk Characters The monk archetype is a strong choice for any character who fights unarmored or with unarmed attacks. Multiclassed monks are typically more centered, philosophical, and disciplined than other members of their class. Barbarian monks with the animal instinct can combine the barbarian's excellent unarmed damage with the monk's diverse unarmed special abilities. Champion monks are perfect for champions of Irori or other deities who favor unarmed attacks. Fighter monks can supplement free-hand fighting and add mobility to the fighter's toolkit. Rogue monks are incredibly effective because stances grant some of the best agile finesse attacks and flurry gives more sneak attacks. Spellcaster monks can augment their combat abilities with haste, runic body, or similar spells to mix magic and martial arts. Spellcaster monks can augment their combat abilities with haste , runic body , or similar spells to mix magic and martial arts. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6211\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6212\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6213\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6214\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6215\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6216\" />",

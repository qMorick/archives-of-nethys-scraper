While traps might grant you less brute force to apply in a fair fight than weapons would, you rarely allow your fights to be fair. Instead, when combat takes place at a location of your choosing, you have a major advantage thanks to your well-placed snares. Once your foes realize that you may have trapped any location on a battlefield, their fear of accidentally setting one off can help you corral them toward the waiting blades of your allies, or even make them too paranoid to move at all, locking them in place. Fearless enemies face their own disadvantage: they run a greater risk of setting off the many traps youve deployed. Even if they somehow avoid them, some cunning snare crafters have the skills to set a trap right under their foes' feet. Others have found they can trigger dangerous snares from a safe distance due to years of practice. Truly, snare crafters make for a dangerous foe and handy ally.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Archetypes/Archetype_Snarecrafter.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6414\" />\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6415\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6416\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6417\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6418\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6419\"\n\n/>",

Multiclass Swashbuckler Characters The swashbuckler archetype is a great fit for martial characters who want to be a bit flashier or for Charismabased spellcasters who want to add a bit of dramatic flair to their routine. Multiclass swashbucklers work especially well for characters who already want to incorporate skill-based action and seek out daring deeds to do in the heat of battle. Barbarian swashbucklers love to show off their strength and brutality with devastating finishers. Champion swashbucklers can show off the powers of their deity to inspire awe in potential converts and fear in enemies of the faith. Investigator swashbucklers might love to solve big cases with an audience to show off their prowess. Monk swashbucklers can take full advantage of their perfectly trained bodies to perform impressive feats. Rogue swashbucklers might hide in the shadows before emerging to put on a flashy show. Spellcaster swashbucklers might want to show off their mastery of both martial and magical arts. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6234\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6235\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6236\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6237\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6238\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6239\" />",

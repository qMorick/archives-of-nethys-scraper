While your improvised items don't last long, they tend to be just what you need in a pinch, and your enemies find that while they might be able to disarm you, the real challenge is keeping you that way. Locked rooms, diabolical traps, and desperate situations are each their own sort of puzzle to you, and the mundane objects around you are the pieces you use to improvise your own solutions. Few are more resourceful. Given time and a handful of gears, bits, and widgets, you can create the perfect tool for just about any situation. Your ingenuity is extremely valuable while adventuring. Adventurers never truly know what's in store for them and often find themselves ill-prepared for the task at hand. Bringing along a scrounger such as you is like bringing any tool that could possibly be needed, provided your constant attempts to break down and reassemble everything aren't a bother.

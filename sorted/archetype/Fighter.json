With further training, you can become a true combat specialist. Multiclass Fighter Characters The fighter archetype grants access to great feats for characters focusing on any combat style, and it’s particularly helpful for characters looking to diversify their offensive abilities or focus on more powerful weapons. Bard fighters lead warriors from the front, using their martial skills to stay in the thick of combat where their audience is. Cleric fighters focus on a style of combat exemplified by their deity. A shield-using warpriest benefits from the best of both worlds in shield feats. Ranger fighters can either specialize in archery or use their fighter feats to pick up an unusual combat style combination. Rogue fighters can make good use of fighter’s free hand, two-weapon fighting, or archery feats. Making multiple Strikes can serve them well. Spellcaster fighters benefit greatly from the additional weapon proficiencies, and fighter is a solid choice for any spellcaster of a particularly martial bent. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5082\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5083\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5084\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5085\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5086\" />",

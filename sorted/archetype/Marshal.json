Marshals can come from any class or background, though they all share a willingness to sacrifice their own glory for the greater good of the team. Some marshals lead from the front, sword and shield raised, while others may call instructions and encouragements from the rear while providing allied spellcasters with skilled support. Regardless of their preferred method of combat, marshals' ability to bring the best out in every ally is a valuable addition to any group. Though not every marshal is seen by their allies as a source of encouragement. Such marshals strike fear both in enemies and allies alike to inspire competence in battle and ensure that cowardice will not be tolerated. Such tactics are often seen as more practical than cruel, and the results speak for themselves. Quick action and the necessity to fight drive these leaders and their allies forward into the fray of battle. Regardless of what kind of marshal you wish to become, you will lead your allies to glory and victory.\n\n While many see marshals as traditionally warriors of martial prowess, anyone could make for a potent marshal. Not every such leader charges into the thick of battle. While doing so may inspire bravery in desperate times, many leaders lead from the safety of the back lines. Spellcaster marshals often lead in this manner. In their mind, the practicality of their own survival outweighs the powerful yet fleeting courage a charge inspires. After all, more battles await in the future, and their skills may very well be needed again.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Archetypes/Archetype_Marshal.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<title level=\"3\">Additional Feats</title>\r\n\r\nThis archetype has some feats at a level other than their original level.\r\nSuch feats are marked with a \\*.\r\n\r\n[Click here for the full rules on Additional Feats](/Rules.aspx?ID=1432).\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6351\" />\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4134\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6352\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6353\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6354\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6355\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7016\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6356\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6357\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6358\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7017\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-5832\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 8*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6359\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7018\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6360\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6361\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7019\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6362\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6363\"\n\n/>",

Though you might feel a kinship for one element over the others, you're capable of shaping many of them. Due to your specialization in elemental magic, you have a smaller, more focused spell list than other spellcasters, though your magic is drawn from multiple traditions. If you choose this class archetype, you must select the Elementalist Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.\n\n **Prerequisites**: You must have a spellcasting class feature that chooses spells from the arcane or primal spell list.\n\n **Elementalist Adjustments**: Replace your spell list with the [elemental spell list](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=5). Your actual magical tradition is unchanged, but you choose your spells from the elemental list instead. You must choose an elemental philosophy (detailed below), which determines which spells and other elemental magic you can use.\n\n **Druid Elementalist Adjustments**: If you're a [druid](/Classes.aspx?ID=6) of the [storm order](/DruidicOrders.aspx?ID=3) and air is in your elemental philosophy, you can choose to replace your starting order spell, [_tempest surge_](/Spells.aspx?ID=479), with [_updraft_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1058).\n\n **Elemental Sorcerer Adjustments**: If you're a [sorcerer](/Classes.aspx?ID=11) with the [elemental bloodline](/Bloodlines.aspx?ID=6), you can replace your initial bloodline spell with an initial elemental focus spell, and your advanced bloodline spell with an advanced elemental focus spell. The initial and advanced elemental focus spells you select must have the same trait as your elemental bloodline.\n\n **Wizard Elementalist Adjustments**: If you're a wizard, you can either choose to be a universalist or to follow an arcane school dedicated to one element from your elemental philosophy. If you choose an elemental school, your curriculum spells can be any spells that you have access to and that have your chosen element's trait. Your school spells are the elemental focus spells of your chosen element, with the 1st-rank spell as your initial school spell and the 3rd-rank spell as the advanced school spell.\n\n**Elemental Focus Spells** \n<ul> <li>**Air** initial: [_updraft_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1304); advanced: [_powerful inhalation_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1305)</li> <li>**Earth** initial: [_crushing ground_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1306); advanced: [_stone lance_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1307)</li> <li>**Fire** initial: [_wildfire_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1308); advanced: [_combustion_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1309)</li> <li>**Metal** initial: [_serrate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1380); advanced: [_repel metal_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1381)</li> <li>**Water** initial: [_rising surf_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1310); advanced: [_pulverizing cascade_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1311)</li> <li>**Wood** initial: [_arms of nature_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1418); advanced: [_wood walk_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1419)</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Elemental Philosophy</title>\r\n\r\nChoose an elemental philosophy, which determines which elements you can use. The options available in this book are as follows. \n<ul><li>**Elemental Cycle**: Earth, fire, metal, water, wood</li><li>**Inner Sea Elementalism**: Air, earth, fire, water</li></ul> Your choice of elemental philosophy affects your spell list, with the spell list for elemental cycle elementalists [found here](SpellLists.aspx?Focus=false&amp;Tradition=5&amp;ElementSort=True&amp;Philosophy=1) and the spell list for the inner sea elementalist [found here](SpellLists.aspx?Focus=false&amp;Tradition=5&amp;ElementSort=True&amp;Philosophy=2). In addition to some universal spells that both philosophies have access to, your personal list also contains any spell that shares one or more traits with those in your elemental philosophy, and doesn't have any traits that aren't in your elemental philosophy. For example, an elemental cycle elementalist could choose a spell with both the earth and fire traits, but not one with the air and fire traits, while an inner sea elementalist could choose either of those, but not a spell with metal and fire traits.\n\nAs _Rage of Elements_ is the first book to include the wood and metal traits, your GM might allow you to add more spells from other books that fit the metal or wood element but first appeared without the trait, adding the relevant trait to the spell.\n\nYou can't take elementalist feats or use elementalist abilities for an element you're unable to attune to. For example, an Inner Sea elementalist couldn't select the [Reverberating Spell](/Feats.aspx?ID=4347) feat, use [Redirect Elements](/Feats.aspx?ID=2992) against a metal or wood spell, or choose a metal or wood ability for their [Elemental Familiar](/Feats.aspx?ID=2988).\n\n<title level=\"3\">Additional Feats</title>\r\n\r\nThis archetype has some feats at a level other than their original level.\r\nSuch feats are marked with a \\*.\r\n\r\n[Click here for the full rules on Additional Feats](/Rules.aspx?ID=1432).\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4340\" />\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4341\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4342\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-604\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 4*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4343\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4344\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-318\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 6*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4345\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4346\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4351\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4348\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4347\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4349\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4350\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4352\"\n\n/>",

Secrets of Magic Elementalist : This section updates and expands the elementalist class archetype originally presented on page 206 of Secrets of Magic . If you're using the version of the archetype from Secrets of Magic and are happy with it, you don't need to make any changes—that original version functions the same as using the new text and choosing Inner Sea elementalism for your elemental philosophy! Elemental Magic (1st) You're a spellcaster who specializes in harnessing the elements. Though you might feel a kinship for one element over the others, you're capable of shaping many of them. Due to your specialization in elemental magic, you have a smaller, more focused spell list than other spellcasters, though your magic is drawn from multiple traditions. If you choose this class archetype, you must select the Elementalist Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat. Prerequisites : You must have a spellcasting class feature that chooses spells from the arcane or primal spell list. Elementalist Adjustments : Replace your spell list with the elemental spell list. Your actual magical tradition is unchanged, but you choose your spells from the elemental list instead. You must choose an elemental philosophy (detailed below), which determines which spells and other elemental magic you can use. Druid Elementalist Adjustments : If you're a druid of the storm order and air is in your elemental philosophy, you can choose to replace your starting order spell, tempest surge , with updraft . Elemental Sorcerer Adjustments : If you're a sorcerer with the elemental bloodline, you can replace your initial bloodline spell with an initial elemental focus spell, and your advanced bloodline spell with an advanced elemental focus spell. The initial and advanced elemental focus spells you select must have the same trait as your elemental bloodline. Wizard Elementalist Adjustments : If you're a wizard, you can either choose to be a universalist or to follow an arcane school dedicated to one element from your elemental philosophy. If you choose an elemental school, your curriculum spells can be any spells that you have access to and that have your chosen element's trait. Your school spells are the elemental focus spells of your chosen element, with the 1st-rank spell as your initial school spell and the 3rd-rank spell as the advanced school spell. Elemental Focus Spells Air initial: updraft ; advanced: powerful inhalation Earth initial: crushing ground ; advanced: stone lance Fire initial: wildfire ; advanced: combustion Metal initial: serrate ; advanced: repel metal Water initial: rising surf ; advanced: pulverizing cascade Wood initial: arms of nature ; advanced: wood walk Elemental Philosophy Choose an elemental philosophy, which determines which elements you can use. The options available in this book are as follows. Elemental Cycle : Earth, fire, metal, water, wood Inner Sea Elementalism : Air, earth, fire, water Your choice of elemental philosophy affects your spell list, with the spell list for elemental cycle elementalists found here and the spell list for the inner sea elementalist found here. In addition to some universal spells that both philosophies have access to, your personal list also contains any spell that shares one or more traits with those in your elemental philosophy, and doesn't have any traits that aren't in your elemental philosophy. For example, an elemental cycle elementalist could choose a spell with both the earth and fire traits, but not one with the air and fire traits, while an inner sea elementalist could choose either of those, but not a spell with metal and fire traits. As Rage of Elements is the first book to include the wood and metal traits, your GM might allow you to add more spells from other books that fit the metal or wood element but first appeared without the trait, adding the relevant trait to the spell. You can't take elementalist feats or use elementalist abilities for an element you're unable to attune to. For example, an Inner Sea elementalist couldn't select the Reverberating Spell feat, use Redirect Elements against a metal or wood spell, or choose a metal or wood ability for their Elemental Familiar.

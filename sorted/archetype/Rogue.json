 "text": " Rogue Source Player Core pg. 221 2.0 You’ve learned to sneak, steal, and disable traps. With time and luck, you’ll become capable of moving through the shadows, striking unseen, and escaping without notice. Multiclass Rogue characters Nearly any character can benefit from the many skills and tricks the rogue archetype grants. Bard rogues expand their robust base of skills. They are also well-suited to take advantage of the distractions caused by their performances and otherwise apply their skills to combat. Cleric rogues often follow gods that support trickery in combat, such as Calistria, learning a combat style that fits their god. However, many clerics might need stealth and trickery when their voices are unwelcome. Druid rogues can ambush foes in other forms, seamlessly fading into the shadows of the natural world. Fighter rogues combine the fighter’s accuracy with extra damage, a deadly combination for archers or finesse fighters. Ranger rogues benefit from the shared focus on trailing foes and catching them off guard. The flurry edge can get you many sneak attacks, and the precision edge doubles down on precision damage. Witch rogues apply the hexes of their patrons from the shadows and improve many of the simple weapons they’re trained in. Wizard rogues use the rogue multiclass to shore up skills or to pick up tricky rogue feats to help keep them safe. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5093\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5094\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5095\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5096\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5097\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5098\" />",

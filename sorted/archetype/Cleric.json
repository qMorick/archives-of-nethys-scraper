Multiclass Cleric Characters Although many characters profess faith in the gods, the cleric archetype represents a character of another class who’s been acknowledged by a particular deity and granted divine spellcasting. Before a character takes the cleric archetype, it’s important to consider the god’s anathema and whether they’ll be able to avoid it. The many domains available to clerics of different deities also present a variety of options for focus spells. Martial clerics are typically looking for a potent domain spell or some healing to use in a pinch. Divine witch clerics double down as the ultimate divine spellcasters.

These drakes take advantage of long distances to hide from the repercussions of their actions, as they are usually among the most depraved and openly malicious of the drakes. They are also especially insolent and are less likely to back down from a fight compared to other drakes. Many frost drakes have met their ends trying to enact cruelties beyond their means, such as singly taking on a frost giant clan or well-fortified township.\n\n Frost drakes hunt alone more often than other drakes, due to a scarcity of prey and simple temperament. Although a single frost drake can wreak much destruction on their own, tales of village-dwelling northerners banding together to defend their homes from these rogue menaces are fairly common. A frost drake's hunting grounds are quite large. Those frost drakes that live upon the permanently frozen peaks of high mountains have been known to swoop down to snatch up prey from the lowlands, leaving frozen swaths of earth from their breath as the only sign of their passing. Their frost-covered scales range from deep royal blue to crisp cyan and sometimes\n\n feature sporadic patches of violet. Their hides are thinner than most drakes'; when a frost drake is inhaling in preparation to launch their signature frozen breath, the monster's ice-blue blood can be seen beneath their scales.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Dragon](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=35)): DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Frost_Drake.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Frost Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2962)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Cold\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=555\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Dragon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=581\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 132 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +14; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=74) ([imprecise](/Rules.aspx?ID=412)) 30 feet, snow vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +15, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +17, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +14, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +15\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +1\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Snow Vision** Snow doesn't impair a frost drake's vision; they ignore [concealment](/Conditions.aspx?ID=62) from snowfall.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 25 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +17 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +15 \r\n\r\n**Will** +14 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 115\n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\n[cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=555), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=696)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=604) 10\r\n\r\n**Retaliatory Strike** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature within reach of the frost drake's tail successfully damages the frost drake with a Strike; **Effect** The frost drake attempts to Strike with their tail.

Clever and adaptable, they hunt and devour all manner of animals. Despite growing up to 16 feet long, a giant octopus can compress its body to squeeze through small gaps as long as there's room for its beak.\n\n Giant octopuses favor shipwrecks, coral reefs, or underwater caverns as lairs, where they can take advantage of narrow confines for protection. Like their smaller kin, they're fond of adorning and decorating their lairs with found objects—many of which, in the giant octopus's case, are also magical weapons, shields, or works of art salvaged from sunken ships or fallen adventurers.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=43)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Giant_Octopus.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Giant Octopus](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3115)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=531\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aquatic\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=533\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 248 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +15; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=69)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +17, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +20, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +17\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** -2\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 27 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +16 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +15 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 135\n\n</row>\n\n**Resistances**\r\n[cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=555) 10\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 15 feet, swim 40 feet; compression\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\narm +20 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+9 bludgeoning plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=45)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nbeak +20,\r\n**Damage** 2d8+9 piercing plus giant octopus venom\n\n**Compression**   A giant octopus can move through a gap at least 2 feet wide without [Squeezing](/Actions.aspx?ID=2372)and can Squeeze through a gap at least 1 foot wide.\r\n\r\n**[Constrict](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=57)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  1d8+9 bludgeoning, DC 26\r\n\r\n**Giant Octopus Venom**  ([Poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126)) **Saving Throw** DC 26 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** 2d6 poison damage and [off-guard](/Conditions.aspx?ID=58) (1 round); **Stage 2** 2d6 poison damage, [clumsy 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=61), and off-guard (1 round); **Stage 3** 2d6 poison damage, clumsy 2, and off-guard (1 round)\r\n\r\n**Ink Cloud** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  The octopus emits a cloud of black ink in a 30-foot emanation.

It ambushes its prey by rushing out from cover and biting the target with its powerful jaws. A giant monitor lizard's saliva is venomous, allowing it to bring down prey larger than it can easily haul away in its jaws. Giant monitor lizards grow up to 14 feet long, including their long tails, and they weigh about 350 pounds. Their bodies are normally dark brown with patches of yellow or green.\n\n When nesting, a giant monitor lizard digs a deep burrow to hide in. The burrow serves as both a safe haven and a location from which the lizard can ambush larger prey such as deer, boars, or even humanoids. A giant monitor lizard can consume nearly its own body weight in a single meal, and its loosely articulated jaws allow it to swallow surprisingly large prey.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=43)): DC 16\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 11\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Giant_Monitor_Lizard.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 2\">[Giant Monitor Lizard](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3088)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=531\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 224 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +7; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=69), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=74) ([imprecise](/Rules.aspx?ID=412)) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +6, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +9, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +6\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +3\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** -2\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 16 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +9 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +8 \r\n\r\n**Will** +5 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 36\n\n</row>\n\n**Gnashing Grip** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature grabbed by the giant monitor lizard's jaws fails a check to [Escape](/Actions.aspx?ID=2296); **Effect** The giant monitor lizard's jaws deal 1d6 piercing damage and the triggering creature is exposed to monitor lizard venom.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet, swim 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +11,\r\n**Damage** 1d10+3 piercing plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=45) and monitor lizard venom\n\n**Lurching Charge** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" />  The giant monitor lizard Strides twice and then makes a jaws Strike.

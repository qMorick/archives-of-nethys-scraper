These massive beings can lie dormant for years in desolate caverns or barren wastelands. When a carnivorous blob perceives living creatures nearby, it lurches to gelatinous life, seeking out and consuming every creature it can catch until it is destroyed or until it has been unable to locate food for 24 hours, at which point it returns to hibernation. Often, keeping food away from a carnivorous blob is the safest way to defeat it. The blob's ability to split into smaller oozes that might stay hidden after a fight means it can be hard to fully eradicate these mindless predators.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Ooze](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 31\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 29\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 26\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Ooze_CarnivorousBlob.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 13\">[Carnivorous Blob](/Monsters.aspx?ID=755)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Gargantuan\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mindless\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=108\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Ooze\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=122\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 195 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\n**Perception** +23; motion sense 240 feet, no vision\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +27\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** -3\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** -5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +0\r\n\r\n**Cha** -5\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Motion Sense** A carnivorous blob can sense nearby creatures through vibration and air or water movement.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 20 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +25 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +14 \r\n\r\n**Will** +19 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 300\n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\nacid, critical hits, [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), piercing, precision, slashing, sonic, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)\n\n**Split** When a carniverous blob that has 10 or more HP is hit by an attack that would deal piercing or slashing damage, it splits into two identical oozes, each with half the original's HP.

Mischievous and playful, these raccoon-headed humanoids love to socialize with mortals and learn about their societies. Unlike their mortal counterparts, Procyals' fur starts off dark russet in color, giving way to gray and white flecks on their muzzles as they grow older. Only procyal leaders boast the stark gray and black coloration of a true raccoon. Those who recognize procyals' age and wisdom treat these creatures with great respect.\n\n Whatever their natural appearance, procyals make excellent shapeshifters and can assume the form of any humanoid that they've encountered. They use this ability only for the greater good of that humanoid or their community, often appearing as someone's trusted mentor to deliver an important message in a more laid-back fashion than talking to a magical celestial raccoon. They're not above playing the occasional harmless prank on the person whose form they've assumed, especially when they can use it to teach a valuable lesson.

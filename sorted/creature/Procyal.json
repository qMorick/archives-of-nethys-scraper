Mischievous and playful, these raccoon-headed humanoids love to socialize with mortals and learn about their societies. Unlike their mortal counterparts, Procyals' fur starts off dark russet in color, giving way to gray and white flecks on their muzzles as they grow older. Only procyal leaders boast the stark gray and black coloration of a true raccoon. Those who recognize procyals' age and wisdom treat these creatures with great respect.\n\n Whatever their natural appearance, procyals make excellent shapeshifters and can assume the form of any humanoid that they've encountered. They use this ability only for the greater good of that humanoid or their community, often appearing as someone's trusted mentor to deliver an important message in a more laid-back fashion than talking to a magical celestial raccoon. They're not above playing the occasional harmless prank on the person whose form they've assumed, especially when they can use it to teach a valuable lesson. Raccoon agathions prefer to use a blade if forced into combat, but they're prepared to use their claws and fight dirty if necessary.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Celestial](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Agathion_Procyal.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Procyal](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1057)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"NG\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Agathion\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=349\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Celestial\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=23\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 11\n\n**Perception** +18; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Celestial](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Halfling](/Languages.aspx?ID=7), [Infernal](/Languages.aspx?ID=19); [_speak with animals_](/Spells.aspx?ID=293), [_tongues_](/Spells.aspx?ID=340)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +14, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +18, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +16, [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +16, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +16, [Nirvana Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +15, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +16, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +17, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +16, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +16, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +14\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** +5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [shortsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=43)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 26 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +16 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +14 \r\n\r\n**Will** +18 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 170\n\n</row>\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nevil 10\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +18 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Good](/Traits.aspx?ID=83), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+10 plus 1d6 good\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_shortsword_ +19 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Good](/Traits.aspx?ID=83), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [versatile S](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+10 plus 1d6 good\r\n\r\n**Divine Innate Spells** DC 26, attack +18\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=164)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Heroism](/Spells.aspx?ID=149)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Calm Emotions](/Spells.aspx?ID=31), [Charm](/Spells.aspx?ID=34), [Dimension Door](/Spells.aspx?ID=69), [Dispel Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=78), [Illusory Creature](/Spells.aspx?ID=158), [Magic Aura](/Spells.aspx?ID=178) (at will), [Suggestion](/Spells.aspx?ID=315) (at will)\r\n- **Constant (5th)**\r\n[Speak with Animals](/Spells.aspx?ID=293), [Tongues](/Spells.aspx?ID=340)\r\n\r\n**Champion Focus Spell** DC 26, 1 Focus Point\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Lay on Hands](/Spells.aspx?ID=395)\r\n\r\n**[Change Shape](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=8)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [Polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [Transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) The procyal can transform only into a specific individual Small or Medium humanoid that they've met at least once.

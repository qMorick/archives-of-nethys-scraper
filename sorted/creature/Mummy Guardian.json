The traditional method of creating a mummy guardian is a laborious and sadistic process that begins well before the poor soul to be transformed is dead. The victim is ritualistically starved of nourishing food and instead fed strange spices, preservative agents, and toxins intended to quicken the desiccation of the flesh. The victim remains immobile but painfully aware during the final stages, as its now-useless entrails are extracted. The victim is then shrouded in funerary wrappings and entombed within a necromantically ensorcelled sarcophagus to await instructions in the potentially distant future. While it's certainly possible to use other methods to create a mummy guardian from an already-deceased body, those who seek to create these foul undead as their guardians in the afterlife often feel that such methods result in inferior undead—the pain and agony of death by mummification being an essential step in the process.\n\n Regardless of the method of their creation, mummy guardians are more than just physical shells of flesh and bone. They retain fragmented, distorted versions of their minds, with only enough memories of their living personality remaining to fuel their undead anger and jealousy of those who yet live. This burning rage only intensifies over the centuries of waiting within a crypt for the chance to actually act, and thus, when most mummy guardians are awoken by tomb robbers or adventurers, they stop at nothing in pursuit of spiteful slaughter.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=46)): DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Mummy_Guardian.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 6\">[Mummy Guardian](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3101)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mummy\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=762\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=722\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Unholy\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=521\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 234 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +16; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20); plus any one language they knew while alive\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +15, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +11\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +0\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** -2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +2\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 23 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +14 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +10 \r\n\r\n**Will** +16 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 125\r\n([void healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=83))\n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\nbleed, [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=571) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=578), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=669), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[alchemical](/Traits.aspx?ID=528) 5 (see alchemical weakness), [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=604) 5\r\n\r\n**Alchemical Weakness** The guardian's weakness to alchemical items not only applies to damage from [alchemical](/Traits.aspx?ID=528) items, but the guardian also takes 5 damage when splashed with non-damaging alchemical items or dosed with alchemical poisons, even if they're immune to their other effects.<br />**Blighted Consumption** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=566), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=669)) **Trigger** A creature within 30 feet eats or drinks (including an alchemical item or potion); **Effect** The food or drink burns like the caustic substances fed to the mummy before its death.

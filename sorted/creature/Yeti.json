Yetis dwell amid the highest, most remote peaks of the world, coming down from their snowy mountain holds to raid, steal livestock, and sometimes feed their insatiable urges for slaughter and destruction. Those folks who live at the foot of a yeti-ruled mountain warn of the “abominable snowmen”: monstrous, fur-covered humanoids who leave strange and bloody tracks in the snow.\n\n In actuality, most yetis protect the world rather than hunt its other denizens, guarding eldritch portals that link the mortal Universe and other, much stranger dimensions of reality. From within these snow-covered arches and ancient stone doorways, aliens, living nightmares, fiends, and worse can emerge into the world. Yetis who guard these portals sometimes succumb to the horrors within, taking on the bloodthirsty urges and horrific behaviors of the very monsters they strive to guard against. Driven out of their clans and forced to wander alone, they give rise to the myth of the abominable snowman. These exiled yetis often fully embrace the corrupting elements that caused their exile in the first place, growing more powerful and more deadly.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=47)): DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Yeti.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 5\">[Yeti](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3247)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=721\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=628\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 354 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +15; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=74) ([imprecise](/Rules.aspx?ID=412)) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +14, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +12, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +11\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** -1\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Snowblind** When [Hiding](/Actions.aspx?ID=2404), the yeti is [concealed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=62) by any snowfall, even if it's not thick enough to make other creatures concealed.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 21 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +15 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +11 \r\n\r\n**Will** +13 \r\n\r\n+4 status to all saves vs. [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=598) and [dreams](/Traits.aspx?ID=582)\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 115\n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\n[cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=555)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=604) 10\r\n\r\n**Nightmare Guardian** Yetis gain a +4 status bonus to saves against fear and against spells and abilities that affect dreams.

These spirits are said to cling to life through possessing victims to escape the punishment awaiting them in the afterlife. Only by trapping, cowing, or destroying such spirits can a mortal hope to drive them back.\n\n Dybbuks, who are most often the spirits of men, hide within possessed victims. Their targets of possession are usually young women on the eve of their wedding nights, which can be seen as an omen of an ill-fitting match, particularly in arranged marriages. Male and nonbinary victims do exist as well, though in lesser quantities, and also often on the eve of a troubled marriage. No one knows for sure why dybbuks are drawn to such situations, though it may be because the transgressive soul of a dybbuk seeks to bring chaos to the most strictly regimented aspects of society.\n\n  A victim possessed by a dybbuk might be loud and crude, refuse to eat or drink, perform profane acts, or otherwise stir up trouble in the victim's household. The possessed victim has no memory of these events after their possession ends.\n\n Certain classes of specially trained priests can expel dybbuks from their victims through exorcism. Typically, this uses a methodology combining smoke, the blowing of a horn from a ram, and the recitation of holy verses. Exorcisms are, however, extremely difficult and dangerous, and require great knowledge and skill on the part of the priest due to the power of these malevolent spirits.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Spirit](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=44)): DC 36\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=46)): DC 36\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 34\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 31\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Dybbuk.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 15\">[Dybbuk](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2967)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=721\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Incorporeal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=632\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Spirit\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=737\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=722\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Unholy\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=521\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 136 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +27; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Chthonian](/Languages.aspx?ID=114), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1); [telepathy](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=79) 100 feet\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +28, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +31, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +27, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +29, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +28\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +7\r\n\r\n**Con** +0\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +8\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 35 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +21 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +28 \r\n\r\n**Will** +29 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 175\r\n([void healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=83))\n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\nbleed, [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=571) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=578), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=669), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nall damage 10 (except [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=610), [_ghost touch_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2840), [spirit](/Traits.aspx?ID=737), or [vitality](/Traits.aspx?ID=509); double resistance vs. non-[magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103))\n\n**[Frightful Presence](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=64)** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=542), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=590), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=598), [mental 30 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=647), DC 33) \r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** fly 50 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nghostly hand +28 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [Unholy](/Traits.aspx?ID=521)),\r\n**Damage** 3d10+14 void plus 2d6 spirit\r\n\r\n**Occult Innate Spells** DC 36, attack +30\r\n- **Cantrips (6th)**\r\n[Telekinetic Projectile](/Spells.aspx?ID=334)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Fear](/Spells.aspx?ID=110) (at will)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Rewrite Memory](/Spells.aspx?ID=1655)\r\n- **5th**\r\n[Chilling Darkness](/Spells.aspx?ID=36) (Ã—2), [Fear](/Spells.aspx?ID=110)\r\n- **6th**\r\n[Dominate](/Spells.aspx?ID=87), [Never Mind](/Spells.aspx?ID=1614), [Telekinetic Maneuver](/Spells.aspx?ID=333) (at will)\r\n\r\n**Malevolent Possession** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [Possession](/Traits.aspx?ID=129)) The dybbuk attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature.

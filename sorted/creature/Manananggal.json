To hide their depravities, these beings disguise themselves as everyday people—typically recluses or eccentrics—and use their proximity to a community to pick out their next targets before striking under cover of night. Manananggals use their long, hollow tongues to drain victims' blood from vital organs such as the liver, and the resulting odd drainage marks make it difficult to determine the exact nature of a victim's death. This mystery typically leads to confusion, terror, and mistrust among communities, which most manananggals savor. While they fly, manananggals make a distinctive ticking sound, leading some to refer to the creatures as “tik-tiks,” and badly affected communities descend into fearful chaos at the first reports of this telltale noise.\n\n Manananggals share their cannibalistic, body-separating traits with other types of tanggals, such as penanggalans, though a number of characteristics set them apart. For instance, whereas penanggalans relish vinegar and even bathe in the substance, manananggals abhor the merest scent of it.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Manananggal](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2775)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Tanggal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=366\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Tian Xia World Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=223) pg. 290\n\n**Perception** +16; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +18, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +16, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +13\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**[Light Blindness](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=68)**\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 26 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +14 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +19 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 180\n\n</row>\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\nslashing 8\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet (or fly 80 feet when body is separated)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaws +18 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+9 slashing plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=45)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +18 ([Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)),\r\n**Damage** 2d10+9 piercing\r\n\r\n**Occult Innate Spells** DC 26\r\n- **Cantrips (4th)**\r\n[Light](/Spells.aspx?ID=171)\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Enfeeble](/Spells.aspx?ID=1513) (×3)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Darkness](/Spells.aspx?ID=59) (×3)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Fear](/Spells.aspx?ID=110)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Sleep](/Spells.aspx?ID=288)\r\n\r\n**Blood Drain** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  **Requirements** The manananggal has a creature grabbed; **Effect** The manananggal drives their tongue into the grabbed creature to drink its blood.

If its lower half is damaged, the manananggal is immediately aware of the attack. Each minute a manananggal remains separated after sunrise and before sunset, it takes 2d6 points of damage until it reattaches its upper and lower torsos or is destroyed, whichever comes first.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Grim Blades</title>\r\n\r\nMinatan folktales have it that a forgotten demigod created the first manananggals by bisecting the torso of a human with a divine knife.

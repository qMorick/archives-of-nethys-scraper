Solitary predators, they use their hypnotic warbling song to drive prey into a wild frenzy, manipulating them into attacking one another so that the cauthooj can then feast on the remains.\n\n Known to some scholars as the puppet master bird, and to others as the shrill shrike, cauthoojs are widely reviled by most intelligent humanoids, in part because they seem to prefer humanoids as prey. Sightings typically lead to the creation of hunting parties to track the creature down before it can kill again, with would-be hunters typically stuffing their ears full of wax in an effort to avoid being affected by its cry. Those who have survived the creature's song report that the experience is uniquely unnerving, and almost all accounts agree that there is no other sound as terrible.\n\n While one might assume the cauthooj is an unintelligent animal, these creatures are smarter than they look. Cauthoojs stalk the perimeter of remote settlements in hopes of finding a lone traveler they can feast upon. They can even understand a few rudimentary words in Fey, although they are incapable of clearly speaking themselves. This doesn't stop the cauthooj from attempting to mimic the sounds it hears, but when it does so, its eerie primal nature enhances the attempt, leading to the bird's signature ability to manipulate minds and encourage conflict, a trait the cauthooj is just barely smart enough to understand—and enjoy.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=35), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=43)): DC 30\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 28\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 25\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Cauthooj.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 12\">[Cauthooj](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2870)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=547\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 53 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +22; thoughtsense ([imprecise](/Rules.aspx?ID=412)) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Fey](/Languages.aspx?ID=119); (can't speak any language)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +24, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +25\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** -3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Thoughtsense** ([mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=662)) The cauthooj senses all non-[mindless](/Traits.aspx?ID=652) creatures at the listed range.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 33 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +25 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +20 \r\n\r\n**Will** +18 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 215\n\n</row>\n\n**Resistances**\r\n[sonic](/Traits.aspx?ID=697) 15\n\n**Hop-Dodge**<actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([move](/Traits.aspx?ID=658)) **Trigger** The cauthooj is the target of a melee Strike and is adjacent to another enemy that is also within the reach of the melee Strike; **Effect** The cauthooj nimbly hops aside, redirecting the triggering Strike against the adjacent enemy.

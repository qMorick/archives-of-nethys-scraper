Most fire giant communities are built around elemental rifts, hot springs, or volcanic calderas and cannot be moved easily, inspiring unwavering defense against any intruders. As a result, their social and political structures are grounded firmly in martial hierarchies, with a strict emphasis on following the orders of one's superior.\n\n As soon as a fire giant can walk, they are fitted with their first suit of forged armor. This armor is constantly remolded and replaced as the giant matures. Beyond what they can forge in their volcanic furnaces, fire giants also look to tame [dinosaurs](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=391), [drakes](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=404), and [hell hounds](/Monsters.aspx?ID=259) as tools of war.\n\n Fire giants are usually identified by their powerful stature and bright orange hair that flickers and dances as if aflame.

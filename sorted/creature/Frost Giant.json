Their clans range from extremely territorial hunters who ferociously defend their expanse of tundra to nomadic families that roam icy slopes in search of settlements to conquer. Frost giant clans are ruled by the family member who exhibits the greatest ferocity and prowess in battle—often a massive bully who demands absolute obedience from the rest.\n\n Frost giants' appearance is reflective of their icy homes, with flesh ranging from a translucent glacial blue to a slushy gray. A typical frost giant stands about 15 feet tall and weighs approximately 2,800 pounds. They often wear metal armor adorned with the furs, skin, teeth, and tusks of slain beasts and heft weapons as long as dining tables. A well-stocked frost giant clan will raise [mammoth](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2994) mounts or press witchwargs into service as hunting companions, but consider their environment too hostile for a soft concept like pets.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=47)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Frost_Giant.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 9\">[Frost Giant](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3013)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Cold\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=555\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Giant\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=616\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=628\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 165 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +17; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=69)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +23, [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +18, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +18, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +17, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +17\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +0\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Breastplate](/Armor.aspx?ID=10), _+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2829) [greataxe](/Weapons.aspx?ID=376)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 29 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +23 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +16 \r\n\r\n**Will** +16 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 150\n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\n[cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=555)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=604) 10\r\n\r\n**[Reactive Strike](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=48)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> \r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet; ice stride\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_greataxe_ +21 ([Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192), [Sweep](/Traits.aspx?ID=194)),\r\n**Damage** 2d12+12 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +21 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+12 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nicicle +19 ([Cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134), [range 120 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=248)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8 piercing plus 3d6 cold\n\n**Chill Breath** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) The frost giant breathes out a 15-foot cone of freezing moisture that quickly condenses into ice, dealing 4d6 cold damage.

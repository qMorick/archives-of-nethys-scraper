Also known as “duck-billed dinosaurs” due to the unusual shape of their jaws, hadrosaurids are lumbering creatures that can rival an elephant in size, although they tend to be much less aggressive and are prone to flight when confronted with danger. Many species of hadrosaurids have uniquely shaped crests on their heads, making them easily recognizable even to amateur dinosaur watchers.\n\n Giants and other oversized creatures have been known to domesticate hadrosaurids to serve as livestock.

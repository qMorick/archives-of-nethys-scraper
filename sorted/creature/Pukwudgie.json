In ancient times, pukwudgies traveled to [the Universe](/Planes.aspx?ID=26) from the [First World](/Planes.aspx?ID=35), perhaps in the wake of the [gnome](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=4) emigration. These proud fey are obsessed with displays of respect, and while they first attempted to befriend mortals, each attempt ended in tragedy as the pukwudgies perceived any potential slight as a grave insult. Mortals, fearing these reactions, began to view pukwudgies as dangerous nuisances. Pukwudgies, in turn, began to resent mortals and the gods that favored them.\n\n At their best, pukwudgies play cruel jokes on mortals they encounter. At their worst, they've been known to kidnap and even kill those who don't treat them with proper respect. Violent fey like [twigjacks](/Monsters.aspx?ID=838) and [redcaps](/Monsters.aspx?ID=349) often gather under pukwudgie leadership, much to the pukwudgies' glee.\n\n Pukwudgies make their villages in the oldest forests, concealed under [_mirage_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1604) spells. They travel freely between the Universe and the First World through tiny portals beneath hills, trees, or stones. No strangers to violence, pukwudgies rarely travel alone and often anoint their quills or weapons with a custom-brewed poison before entering hostile situations.\n\n Standing about 2 feet tall, a pukwudgie sports sharp quills growing from their head that extends down their back. Their skin tone varies by the region in which they live, ranging from pale gray to brown.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Fey](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=43)): DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Pukwudgie.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Pukwudgie](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3153)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fey\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=599\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 279 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +17; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=69)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Elven](/Languages.aspx?ID=4), [Fey](/Languages.aspx?ID=119), [Gnomish](/Languages.aspx?ID=5)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) +15, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +14, [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) +15, [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) +17, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +17, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +15\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [hatchet](/Weapons.aspx?ID=382)_, [Shortbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=77)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 25 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +12 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +15 \r\n\r\n**Will** +17 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 100\n\n</row>\n\n**Resistances**\r\n[poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=669) 5\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375) 10\r\n\r\n**Defensive Quills** A creature that hits a pukwudgie with an [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719) Strike or a non-[reach](/Traits.aspx?ID=684) melee Strike takes 3d8 piercing damage ([basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save).

Though highly intelligent and usually brimming with compassion, phoenixes are best known for their iconic ability to resurrect themselves when slain, emerging reborn from the ashes of their own corpses. Phoenixes are often sought out for their knowledge of healing abilities, as they cannot abide the sight of suffering and deny their succor only to the most foul and irredeemable of creatures.\n\n Phoenixes enjoy the company of peaceful dragons, and the two can forge lifelong friendships, keeping each other updated on regional news. While most phoenixes are benevolent, they are not infallible. When a phoenix loses their way, they still retain their strong appetite for knowledge.

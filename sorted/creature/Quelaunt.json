Its limbs are distributed so evenly across its body that it's all but impossible to tell which way the creature is oriented at any given time. Few who witness a quelaunt linger on its alien looks for long though, as the invasion of their minds becomes a more pressing concern, sowing doubt, sorrow, and rage. This monstrosity not only delights in the negative emotions of its prey, but feeds on them, gaining strength and sustenance from their dismay. For the quelaunt, no act is too terrible or cruel to inflict on its victims, since the more a creature suffers, the more the quelaunt feasts.\n\n Quelaunts are known to associate with other aberrant horrors, including [jah-tohls](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2930) and other creatures associated with the [Dominion of the Black](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=394). However, the more prevalent theory paints them as more alien—perhaps invasive beings from another dimension of pure thought and feeling—and claims that in their natural state they have no physical bodies at all. Few dare speculate further; the only known autopsy of a quelaunt resulted in the researcher's suicide just days afterward and all the notes were mysteriously destroyed. Whatever secrets there are to be unlocked in the anatomy of these bizarre monsters are apparently important enough to warrant great protection from quelaunts, even after death.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=44)): DC 34\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 32\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 29\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Quelaunt.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 15\">[Quelaunt](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3159)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=523\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 285 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +29; [tremorsense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=82) ([imprecise](/Rules.aspx?ID=412)) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=13); (can't speak any language); [telepathy](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=79) 100 feet\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +30, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +30, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +27\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +8\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 36 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +27 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +26 \r\n\r\n**Will** +31 (+33 vs. [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=590))\n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 305\n\n</row>\n\n**Resistances**\r\n[mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647) 15\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 40 feet; [_fly_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1534)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +30 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 3d8+12 slashing\r\n\r\n**Occult Innate Spells** DC 39\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Laughing Fit](/Spells.aspx?ID=1583)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Fear](/Spells.aspx?ID=110) (at will)\r\n- **7th**\r\n[Wave of Despair](/Spells.aspx?ID=1757) (×3)\r\n- **Constant (4th)**\r\n[Fly](/Spells.aspx?ID=125)\r\n\r\n**Emotional Focus**   The quelaunt can cast the following cleric domain spells as 8th-rank occult innate spells at will without spending Focus Points: [_captivating adoration_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1829), [_delusional pride_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1787), and [_ignite ambition_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1782).\r\n\r\n**Emotional Frenzy** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" />  The quelaunt casts up to three spells chosen from its at-will innate spells and its emotional focus spells.\r\n\r\n**Feed on Emotion** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [Incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The quelaunt feeds on the emotional unrest of a single creature within 30 feet that's under a harmful [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=590) effect.

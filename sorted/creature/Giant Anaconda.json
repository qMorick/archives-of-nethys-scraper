Although novice bushwhackers watch out for snakes that might drop on them from the jungle canopy above, giant anacondas are most commonly encountered in ponds and rivers, where they feed on prey including manatees and capybaras. This hunting tactic allows anacondas to drown their prey while constricting it, reducing the chance of injuries while hunting. Despite lurid and sensational stories spread by adventurers, these snakes rarely attack humanoids.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=43)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Giant Anaconda](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3203)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Huge\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=531\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 317 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +17; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=69), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=74) ([imprecise](/Rules.aspx?ID=371)) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +15, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +21, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +15, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +15\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +7\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +6\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** -2\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 25 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +20 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +17 \r\n\r\n**Will** +15 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 175\n\n</row>\n\n**Tighten Coils** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=77) or [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=90) by the python attempts to [Escape](/Actions.aspx?ID=2296); **Effect** The DC of the Escape check is increased by 2.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet, climb 30 feet, swim 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +19 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d10+7 piercing plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=45)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntail +19 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 15 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+7 bludgeoning plus [Push](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=47) 10 feet\n\n**[Greater Constrict](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=65)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  1d10+7 bludgeoning, DC 26\r\n\r\n**Slither** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  The giant anaconda Strides, [Climbs](/Actions.aspx?ID=2374), or [Swims](/Actions.aspx?ID=2381) up to half its Speed, pulling any creatures it has [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=77) with it.\r\n\r\n**[Swallow Whole](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=77)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Attack](/Traits.aspx?ID=15)) Large, 1d10+7 bludgeoning, Rupture 21\r\n\r\n**Wrap in Coils** <actions string=\"Single Action\" />  **Requirements** A Large or smaller creature is [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=77) or [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=90) in the giant anaconda's jaws; **Effect** The giant anaconda moves the creature into its coils, freeing its jaws to make attacks, then uses Greater Constrict against the creature.

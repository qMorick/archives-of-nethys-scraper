When closing in for the kill, the dullahan first whispers their victim's name, then swiftly collects their prize, casting a pall of dread upon all who witness the grim execution.\n\n A dullahan manifests when a particularly violent warrior is beheaded and the warrior's soul stubbornly clings to material existence (or is refused entry to the afterlife). Most dullahans return to their former homelands, where they can exact vengeance on those they feel wronged them in life (or their living descendants). A dullahan's concept of justice is swift and merciless, and once they've selected a target, they're unwavering in their cause.\n\n Perhaps even more than revenge, a dullahan desires their own rotted head. An individual who wields the head of a dullahan is powerful indeed, for a dullahan will grudgingly serve such a master in the hopes of reclaiming their missing skull. Mighty fiends such as [devils](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=389) command dullahans to harvest souls or lead armies for them, while a mortal might use such an undead warrior to fulfill a personal vendetta. A dullahan won't hesitate to kill their liege and reclaim their head when the opportunity presents itself.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=46)): DC 25\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 23\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Dullahan.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 7\">[Dullahan](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2964)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=721\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=722\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Unholy\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=521\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 134 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +14; [lifesense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=67) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +15, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +17, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +13, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +15\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Full Plate](/Armor.aspx?ID=13), _+1 [hatchet](/Weapons.aspx?ID=382)_, _+1 [longsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=386)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 28 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +13 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +15 \r\n\r\n**Will** +17 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 95\r\n([fast healing 5](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=62))\n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\nbleed, [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=598), [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=571) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=578), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=669), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95)\n\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[holy](/Traits.aspx?ID=517) 5\r\n\r\n**[Frightful Presence](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=64)** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=542), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=590), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=598), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647)) 30 feet, DC 23<br />**[Reactive Strike](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=48)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> \r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 20 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_keen longsword_ +18 ([Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [versatile P](/Traits.aspx?ID=200)),\r\n**Damage** 1d8+10 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_keen returning hatchet_ +17 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Sweep](/Traits.aspx?ID=194)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+10 slashing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfist +18 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Nonlethal](/Traits.aspx?ID=188)),\r\n**Damage** 1d4+10 bludgeoning\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_keen returning hatchet_ +14 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [thrown 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+10 slashing\n\n**Head Hunter**   Any slashing weapon gains the [_keen_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2843) rune while a dullahan wields it, and any [hatchet](/Weapons.aspx?ID=382) they wield gains the [_returning_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2845) rune as well.

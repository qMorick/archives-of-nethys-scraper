Even in the deepest wilderness, barghests choose the most clever or difficult prey, searching endlessly for challenges like [giants](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=420), [nymphs](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=449), and [unicorns](/Monsters.aspx?ID=397). More than victory or even the possibility of a meal at the end, barghests enjoy the thrill of the chase and the fear they create within their prey. Particularly terrified targets of a hunting barghest might even be allowed to escape, spreading the terror and enticing hunters who can become the barghest's next victims. A handful of barghests resort to learning magical methods of causing fear directly, though they find such fear hollow and unsatisfying.\n\n Although they rarely tolerate the competition of another barghest's presence, these hunters will happily work with anyone who helps them find prey to torment and kill. This often involves enforcing the will of [hags](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=425) or particularly cruel [fey](/Languages.aspx?ID=119), but a bored barghest might also force a family of weaker humanoids to work as scouts and bait.\n\nTypical barghests often make use of their shapechanging abilities to hide in plain sight, only taking their true forms to frighten their prey and exult in the hunt. However, they are often still exposed by their trail of victims or the curiously unhealing wounds they inflict, even in humanoid form. Tales of powerful barghests with invisible heads are sometimes told in remote and dwindling villages. These barghests generally dispense with hiding as a humanoid or dog, instead terrifying entire communities and openly hunting increasingly dangerous prey. Some also extend this pride to their intellect, insisting on matching wits with their prey or even with those who believe they're hunting the barghest.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=35), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=43)): DC 19\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 14\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Barghest.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 4\">[Barghest](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2846)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=547\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Unholy\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=521\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 38 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +12; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=74) ([imprecise](/Rules.aspx?ID=412)) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Fey](/Languages.aspx?ID=119), [Goblin](/Languages.aspx?ID=6), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=8)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +13, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +11, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +9, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +11, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +10, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +12\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 20 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +11 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +12 \r\n\r\n**Will** +8 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 50\n\n</row>\n\n**Resistances**\r\nphysical 5 (except [cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375))\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\n[holy](/Traits.aspx?ID=517) 5\r\n\r\n**Primal Hunt** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=676), [teleportation](/Traits.aspx?ID=710)) **Trigger** A creature within the barghest's reach takes a [move](/Traits.aspx?ID=658) or [teleportation](/Traits.aspx?ID=710) action; **Effect** After the triggering action, the barghest can teleport up to 60 feet to a space adjacent to that creature.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 25 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +13 ([Unholy](/Traits.aspx?ID=521)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+5 piercing plus [Knockdown](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=46)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +13 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Unholy](/Traits.aspx?ID=521)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+5 slashing plus unhealing wound\r\n\r\n**Primal Innate Spells** DC 21\r\n- **Cantrips (2nd)**\r\n[Figment](/Spells.aspx?ID=1528), [Light](/Spells.aspx?ID=171)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=164), [Mist](/Spells.aspx?ID=1606)\r\n\r\n**[Change Shape](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=55)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([Concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [Polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [Primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=134)) The barghest takes on the shape of a [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=628), a dog, or its true form.

Creatures affected by this curse grow reckless, becoming unaware of the consequences of their own actions. This makes the hapless victim all the more susceptible to the lamia's cunning illusions and insidious charms. The lamia's animalistic nature and the effect of their cursed touch have led some scholars to theorize that the original lamias must have, millennia ago, turned away from their own reason and intellect and embraced the life of simple beasts. Whether this change was rewarded as a monstrous gift from [Lamashtu](/Deities.aspx?ID=287) or inflicted as a curse for abandoning their responsibilities by [Pharasma](/Deities.aspx?ID=290), remains a subject of debate to this day.\n\n Whatever the source of this ancient transformation, lamias have grown to enjoy the strengths it has granted them. They continue to cling to a hatred of the gods, seeing them as the cause of their eternal exile from the societies they watch with jealous eyes while hidden amid the ruins of lost civilizations. Because lamias blame divine powers for their curse, they take special delight in the downfall of temples, the suffering and death of divine spellcasters, and the spread of dissension within organized religions.\n\n While they can briefly assume humanoid form with magic, lamias are usually forced to hide from civilization, making their homes in the barren wilderness. There, they attract cults of their own. With the help of these cultists, lamias strive to bring down popular faiths, introduce schisms into flourishing churches, and humiliate or defame high-profile religious leaders. Most lamias have no true religious faith in anything, hearing instead a mystical calling that manifests as sighs on the desert wind or murmurs from the dark places between the stars.\n\n Lamias are traditionally matriarchal, revering the eldest female among them as leader, mother, and shaman.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=35), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=43)): DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=47)): DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Lamia.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 6\">[Lamia](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3077)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=547\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=628\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 214 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +13; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Chthonian](/Languages.aspx?ID=114), [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +16, [Cult Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +11, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +15, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +11, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +13, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +15, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +11\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n[Javelin](/Weapons.aspx?ID=71) (2), _+1 [spear](/Weapons.aspx?ID=365)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 24 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +12 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +15 \r\n\r\n**Will** +15 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 95\n\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 40 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_spear_ +17,\r\n**Damage** 1d6+10 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntail +16 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+10 bludgeoning plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=45)\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n_spear_ +14 ([thrown 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+10 piercing\r\n\r\n**Ranged**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njavelin +13 ([thrown 30 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=195)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+10 piercing\r\n\r\n**Occult Innate Spells** DC 25\r\n- **1st**\r\n[Illusory Disguise](/Spells.aspx?ID=159) (at will), [Illusory Object](/Spells.aspx?ID=160) (at will), [Ventriloquism](/Spells.aspx?ID=356) (at will)\r\n- **2nd**\r\n[Blur](/Spells.aspx?ID=28), [Humanoid Form](/Spells.aspx?ID=153) (at will)\r\n- **3rd**\r\n[Sleep](/Spells.aspx?ID=288)\r\n- **4th**\r\n[Charm](/Spells.aspx?ID=34) (×3), [Suggestion](/Spells.aspx?ID=315)\r\n\r\n**Lamia's Caress** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) The lamia touches a creature, who must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or become [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=94).

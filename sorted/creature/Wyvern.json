As much as 15 feet long and weighing up to 1,000 pounds, a wyvern's resilient body allows them to crash talons-first into large prey without serious risk to themself. A wyvern uses their momentum to stun their target before injecting it with searing venom or carrying it over the side of a nearby cliff. Because a wyvern lacks the strength to haul their prey all the way to their nest intact, they're far more likely to lift and drop their victim over a gully or canyon and let gravity do its work before they descend to pick apart the carcass.\n\n Conversation is of little interest to a wyvern, as the creature typically speaks only to taunt their prey, issue territorial claims, or demand tribute. Even so, many wyverns enjoy grim humor and tales of violent acts, particularly if those acts were committed by the storyteller. A wyvern properly appeased with meat, entertainment, and treasure sometimes agrees to provide assistance ranging from giving directions to serving as a mount for a powerful humanoid. However, these arrangements rarely last more than a few weeks before the wyvern's pride, malice, or insolence inspires them to flee or even betray their allies. Only the truly cruel can cow a wyvern into servitude for an extended period, as most wyverns are so self-interested that they go out of their way to avoid helping others.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Dragon](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=35)): DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Wyvern.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 6\">[Wyvern](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2961)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Dragon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=581\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 131 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +13; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=74) ([imprecise](/Rules.aspx?ID=412)) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +14, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +15, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +12\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -2\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 24 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +16 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +12 \r\n\r\n**Will** +13 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 95\n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\n[paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=696)\n\n**[Reactive Strike](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=48)** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> <br />**Savage** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=77) or [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=90) by the wyvern critically fails a skill check to [Escape](/Actions.aspx?ID=2296); **Effect** The wyvern makes a stinger Strike against the triggering creature.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 20 feet, fly 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nfangs +17,\r\n**Damage** 2d12+5 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nclaw +17,\r\n**Damage** 2d8+5 slashing plus [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=45)\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nstinger +15 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+5 piercing plus wyvern venom\n\n**Powerful Dive** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Move](/Traits.aspx?ID=114)) The wyvern Flies up to their fly Speed and must both move forward at least 20 feet and descend at least 10 feet.

Its collective consciousness encapsulates entire regions, spreading as far as its ever-growing cloud of spores will take it. Once it has seeped into [the Universe](/Planes.aspx?ID=26) from the Rifts, a terotricus's agenda is to feed on all living creatures, infecting them with its spores, and its presence can spell doom for any in its way.\n\n Terotricuses move by rapidly expanding and contracting their slimy “bodies,” which are capable of burrowing through soil, gliding across water, and scrabbling up steep slopes. These behemoths of rot don't need to travel to see their plans come to fruition, though; their spores easily latch onto demons and other denizens of the Outer Rifts, who in turn bring this blight to the Universe when the fiends are summoned.\n\n When a terotricus infects a creature with its spores, web-like fungal growths start appearing on the victim's skin until they cover the entire body, at which point the victim's mind is also subdued and bent to the terotricus's will. The terotricus's favored victims include animals, elves, and fey, though it is happy to infect any creature it can catch.

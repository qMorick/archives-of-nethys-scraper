They are typically found in abundant numbers, but since they cannot fit in the nooks where mundane rats typically hide, they are much easier to locate and exterminate. They mostly live in sewers where they can scavenge from the streets above, but some families of giant rats live in more remote locations, such as dank caves, forests or hills. Rats are incredibly adept survivors and can be found nearly anywhere in the world, though they tend to favor temperate or warm climates as opposed to cold regions.\n\n Although its bite alone is not lethal except to the very young or very old, the giant rat carries the putrid plague common to rodents around the world—a pestilence more than capable of ravaging rural communities.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=43)): DC 13\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 11\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 8\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Giant_Rat.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature -1\">[Giant Rat](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3162)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=531\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 288 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +5; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=69), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=74) ([imprecise](/Rules.aspx?ID=412)) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +5, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +2, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +5\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +1\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +1\r\n\r\n**Cha** -3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 15 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +6 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +7 \r\n\r\n**Will** +3 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 8\n\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet, climb 10 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +7 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179)),\r\n**Damage** 1d6+1 piercing plus putrid plague\n\n**Putrid Plague**  ([Disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46)) The [sickened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=91) and [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95) conditions from putrid plague can't end or be reduced until the disease is cured; **Saving Throw** DC 14 Fortitude; **Stage 1** carrier with no ill effect (1d4 hours), **Stage 2** [sickened 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=91) (1 day), **Stage 3** sickened 1 and [slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=92) (1 day), **Stage 4** [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95) (1 day), **Stage 5** dead\r\n\r\n</column>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"creature-family-462\" />",

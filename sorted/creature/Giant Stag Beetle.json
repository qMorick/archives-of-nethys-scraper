Its enormous mandibles are used to impress mates, intimidate rivals, and discourage predators, for they can deliver deadly blows. While giant stag beetles are deadly predators, skilled wranglers can domesticate them. In such a capacity, these beetles serve well as beasts of burden or even as mounts.\n\n Giant stag beetles can be a serious menace in marshes, cavern complexes, and heavy forests.

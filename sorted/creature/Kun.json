These massively powerful creatures could easily rule a subaquatic domain if they cared to, but kuns are also famous for their total self-absorption and complete ambivalence toward other forms of life. Kuns remain as far away from other creatures as they can, subsisting on only their own icy hatred. They can consume and digest prey, but such feedings are incidental or driven more by spite than any physical need. Most kuns remain ignorant and uncaring, keeping themselves in the dark and disregarding any signs of life around them except to occasionally lash out when disturbed.\n\n The kun hunts at the bottom of the cold, dark sea. But if shown the light of the sun, a kun begins to understand that it dwells within a different, bigger world. When flocks of birds or schools of fish cast their dappled shadows upon a kun, they might grow weary of their solitude or become curious about the realm above.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 34\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 32\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 29\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 14\">[Kun](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2774)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Gargantuan\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aquatic\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=168\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Cold\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=27\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Unholy\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=521\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Tian Xia World Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=223) pg. 289\n\n**Perception** +27; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59), [light blindness](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=68), [wavesense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=84) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Thalassic](/Languages.aspx?ID=113); (can't speak any language)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +25, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +29, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +22, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +25\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** +1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +5\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 36 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +29 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +24 \r\n\r\n**Will** +23 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 230\n\n</row>\n\n**Resistances**\r\ncold 10\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\nholy 10\r\n\r\n**Spite** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** A creature within reach of the kun's tail uses an action to heal or help anyone else **Effect** The kun bats the triggering creature away with their tail, making a tail Strike against the creature.

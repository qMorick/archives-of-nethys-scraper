When they aren't sleeping or stalking prey, giant frilled lizards bask in the sunlight for hours at a time. Explorers sometimes mistakenly think they are related to dragons due to their large size, elaborate neck frills (which, when displayed in a show of aggression and dominance, can be mistaken for wings), and ferocious hissing vocalizations used to frighten away creatures too large to eat.\n\n A giant frilled lizard's primary food sources are oversized arthropods and other invertebrates, but it won't hesitate to augment its diet with vertebrates, including other lizards, monkeys, and just about anything it can fit into its mouth—even humanoids. Although capable of short bursts of speed, a giant frilled lizard normally lies perfectly still while hunting, hoping to ambush its prey.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=43)): DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 18\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 15\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 5\">[Giant Frilled Lizard](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3089)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=531\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 225 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +11; [low-light vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=69), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=74) ([imprecise](/Rules.aspx?ID=412)) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +10, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +14, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +10\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +1\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 22 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +13 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +12 \r\n\r\n**Will** +9 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 75\n\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** 30 feet, climb 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\njaws +16 ([reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d8+7 piercing\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\ntail +16 ([Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [reach 10 feet](/Traits.aspx?ID=192)),\r\n**Damage** 2d6+7 bludgeoning\n\n**Intimidating Display** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([Auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [Emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [Fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) The giant frilled lizard Strides.

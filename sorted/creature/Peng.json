Their bright plumage makes it difficult to see their shape against an azure sky, but with patience, an onlooker might notice movement too swift to be a natural cloud.\n\n Beautiful and graceful, a peng arises from the unlikeliest of origins: the cruel kun, a hateful fish monster whose predilection for the crushing depths of the sea matches the peng's own love of the bright, open sky. After a kun sacrifices their power for a noble heart by bathing in the sun's rays, they transform into this majestic bird, which eschews violence unless they must fight to stay free.\n\n A peng doesn't seek danger or thrills; they want only to make their long voyages and fly without disruption. However, they sometimes come into conflict with dragons and other high-flying creatures that would hunt them or block their path. Although it's unclear to mortals what purpose a peng's journeys serve, celestial powers related to air or freedom will sometimes ask their mortal followers to assist a peng in its journey.\n\n A peng's calm and steady nature is so strong that its mere presence can quell storms and still winds. Spotting a peng is undoubtedly a sign of good luck for sailors and mariners—a feeling shared with most others lucky enough to lay eyes on these rare and beautiful creatures.

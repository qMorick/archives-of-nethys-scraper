Whatever their specific reasons for joining the organization, armigers share the Hellknights' dedication to spreading the rule of law across Golarion. This commitment sees them serving in a variety of missions, whether it be rooting out bandits and crooks, imprisoning smugglers and black marketeers, or investigating rumors of sedition. While frontier villagers sometimes welcome the assurance of safety that the Hellknights bring, free thinkers and historians chafe at the restrictions on movement and expression that armigers enforce.\n\n Although armigers are not yet full knights, those who underestimate them have made a grievous error. Once ordered to take a position or eliminate a foe, an armiger is unerring in fulfilling their order.

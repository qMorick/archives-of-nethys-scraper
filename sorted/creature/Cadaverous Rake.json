Appearing as a corpse-like version of their living form, a cadaverous rake retains their memories and much of their personality. The first act of many cadaverous rakes is to pay a surprise visit to family and friends, unveiling their revival. If they're met with revulsion or attempts to lay them to rest, the rake typically lashes out at the perceived betrayal or departs in offended confusion. Cadaverous rakes who are appropriately feted by friends and family often retain an affection and attachment, becoming undying protectors. This isn't necessarily a good thing, however, as the cadaverous rake's undead worldview creates impossible demands. The transition to undeath corrupts previously benevolent individuals, and their single-minded focus on finding more opponents to duel cuts a bloody swath across stretches of countryside they once protected. Rarely, those who were especially virtuous retain some of their moral code, though even then their dispositions are mercurial. All, however, retain the flamboyance and swagger that made them notable in life, as quick with a quip as they are with a blade. The impulse to toy with their opponents becomes the undoing of many an overconfident rake.\n\n Though most cadaverous rakes rise after losing a duel, especially those that involved foul play, any cause of death can suffice, save for a peaceful passing in old age.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)): DC 26\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 21\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/CadaverousRake.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Cadaverous Rake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1844)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"CE\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=160\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Book of the Dead](/Sources.aspx?ID=118) pg. 78\n\n**Perception** +16; (18 to initiative) [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +18, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +19, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +16, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +18, [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) +16\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** +3\r\n\r\n**Wis** +2\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n**Items**\r\n_+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [rapier](/Weapons.aspx?ID=36)_\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 27 (29 with Parry Dance)\r\n\r\n**Fort** +16 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +20 \r\n\r\n**Will** +12 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 125\r\n([negative healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42))\n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\n[death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)\n\n**Repartee Riposte** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) **Trigger** A creature within the cadaverous rake's reach critically fails at a melee Strike against the rake; **Effect** The cadaverous rake attempts a Strike against the creature, firing back a witty retort.

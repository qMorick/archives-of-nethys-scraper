They're stronger and more violent, but their uncontrolled vision of possible futures has driven them beyond reason. They see every moment as a potential storm of uncontrollable fury and, out of a desperate desire for peace, quiet, and an end to their hunger, lash out at any who come near. Wise creatures avoid great cyclopes at all cost. It's fortunate for humanoids that great cyclopes prefer to dwell far from settlements.\n\n Debate has long raged over the origins of these massive, destructive giants. They are so large that it had long been assumed they were used as beasts of burden by their lesser kin, now free to hunt and kill without restraint. Other scholars believe the great cyclops is the ultimate fate of the entire cyclops species.

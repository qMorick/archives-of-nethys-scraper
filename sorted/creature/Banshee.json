Some banshees arise from those who were slain by trusted friends and allies, or whose loved ones betrayed them on their deathbeds. Others spawn from those whose treacherous deeds shortly before their deaths left a stain upon their souls. Regardless of their origin, banshees despise the living. This hatred of life is all too often a horrific inversion of their personalities in life. Some speculate that the more kind-hearted the person (and the more wrenching the betrayal), the crueler the banshee.\n\n Banshees rarely stray far from where they perished and typically haunt thick forests and canopied swamps where little light graces the ground. Many banshees are elves and can be found in the elven nation of Kyonin, specifically in Tanglebriar, the sinister domain of the demon [Treerazer](/Monsters.aspx?ID=394). Similarly, a large number of banshees can be found lurking in the frozen wastes in northern Avistan, created from a cruel and widespread betrayal that is centuries old.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Spirit](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=44)): DC 38\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=46)): DC 38\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 36\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 33\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Banshee.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 17\">[Banshee](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2845)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=721\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Ghost\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=753\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Spirit\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=737\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=722\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Unholy\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=521\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 37 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +32; hears heartbeats ([imprecise](/Rules.aspx?ID=412)) 60 feet, [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Elven](/Languages.aspx?ID=4)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +31, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +32, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +25\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** -5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +6\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** +0\r\n\r\n**Wis** +7\r\n\r\n**Cha** +7\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Hears Heartbeats** The banshee can hear heartbeats within 60 feet of it as an imprecise sense.<br />**Sunlight Powerlessness** A banshee in sunlight is [clumsy 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=61) and [stunned 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=93).\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 39 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +25 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +29 \r\n\r\n**Will** +32 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 250\r\n([void healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=83))\n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\nbleed, [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=571) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=578), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=669), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nall damage 12 (except [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=610), [_ghost touch_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2840), [spirit](/Traits.aspx?ID=737), or [vitality](/Traits.aspx?ID=509); double resistance vs. non-[magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=644))\n\n**Vengeful Spite** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=662)) **Trigger** A foe critically hits the banshee, or the banshee critically fails their save against a foe's damaging effect; **Effect** The banshee lashes back at their tormentor, dealing 4d10+14 mental damage with a DC 38 [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Will save and applying the effects of terrifying touch based on the results of the same Will save.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Speed** fly 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Melee**\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\nhand +32 ([Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), [Magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)),\r\n**Damage** 4d10+14 void plus terrifying touch\n\n**Spectral Ripple**   When a banshee Strides at least 10 feet, they're [concealed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=62) until the start of their next turn.\r\n\r\n**Terrifying Touch**  ([Emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [Fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [Occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) A creature damaged by the banshee's touch that isn't already [frightened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=76) must attempt a DC 38 Will save (DC 43 if the attack was a critical hit).

This Wail overcomes [_silence_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1674) and similar effects of 5th rank or lower. The banshee can instead use Wail as a three-action activity to overcome such effects of up to 8th rank.<br /> The banshee's Wail resonates for 1 round, and any creature that comes within the area during that time must attempt a save against the effect. A creature can't be affected more than once by the same Wail.

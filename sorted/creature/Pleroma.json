Their physical manifestation is a constant state of flux between these two extremes; their forms are draped in a hooded, shifting cloak of night black where galaxies and other celestial objects flit in and out of existence at every moment, as if depicting the constant life, death, and rebirth of a miniature, self-contained universe.\n\n Pleromas see the multiverse as both eternal and cyclical, doomed and malleable, ending only if these cycles ever become unbalanced.

A sphere vanishes after 1 minute, when it is more than 300 feet from the pleroma, or when the pleroma Generates a Sphere of that type again.

A sphere of oblivion destroys unattended objects it touches, though larger objects are destroyed at a rate of one 10-foot cube per round of contact.<br /> The sphere can enter the space of a creature; when it does, the creature takes 20d6 damage with a DC 43 Fortitude save. This is an [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=631) effect.<br /> **Success** The creature takes no damage and is pushed out of the sphere to the nearest open space of the GM's choice.<br /> **Failure** The creature takes full damage; this is vitality damage for a sphere of creation or void damage for a sphere of oblivion, but it can damage any type of creature regardless of its normal immunities. The creature is then pushed out of the sphere as on a success. A creature reduced to 0 HP is slain instead of being pushed out, either merged with new matter for a sphere of creation or completely destroyed for a void of oblivion; the creature can be restored only via a [_wish_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=125) ritual or similarly powerful effect. This is a [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=571) effect.<br /> **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature takes double damage.\r\n\r\n</column>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"creature-family-357\" />",

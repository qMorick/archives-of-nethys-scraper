Plot Hooks Game Masters might consider the following plot hooks as a means of integrating the bookseller Morlibint into any Pathfinder Second Edition game. Morlibint's rarest almanac has been stolen and he hires the heroes to discover who took it and why. The heroes consult Morlibint to learn more about a creature's peculiar ability or resistance. Morlibint searches through fictional accounts of the creature to find the answer, which might not be entirely accurate. Morlibint has learned the location of a particularly valuable tome and offers the heroes both the opportunity to retrieve it (he only wants to copy a few pages from it) and hints about the curse the tome reputedly imparts on those who carry it.

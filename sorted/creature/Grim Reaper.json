Silent as the grave and inexorable as time itself, this legendary being hunts down creatures that have evaded death for too long. Sometimes the Grim Reaper comes without warning. Other times it comes to finish the work others could not. The Grim Reaper serves no god, [fiend](/Traits.aspx?ID=600), [aeon](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=357), or otherworldly being. It's both despised and feared by [psychopomps](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=458) and [celestials](/Languages.aspx?ID=16), but few—if any—dare stand in its way. Like some eternal plague, it kills any who try to cure the multiverse of its presence. It stands alone and keeps its own council. The pleas of mortals and immortals alike fall on deaf ears once the Grim Reaper chooses its quarry. Its reasoning is silent and inscrutable to the mortal mind, but no matter its choice, the result is final.\n\n While some legends claim that the Grim Reaper appears to everyone when they die, the truth is more disturbing. Such vigils are the providence of psychopomps, immortals charged with the protection and guidance of mortal souls through the afterlife. The Grim Reaper instead enacts the sinister agenda of [Abaddon](/Planes.aspx?ID=37), where the Apocalypse Riders rule. Indeed, there are many similarities in shape and form between the Grim Reaper and [Charon](/Deities.aspx?ID=135), the Rider of Death, but there are no recorded instance of these entities working together. Instead, the Grim Reaper serves as something of a manifestation of Abaddon itself, and in this regard, is believed to be an incarnation of the mysterious First Rider. When the Grim Reaper visits a world, it does so not as an angel of mercy but a relentless harvester of life. Those who fall to the Grim Reaper were not destined to die as much as they were selected, hunted, and murdered.\n\n Perhaps the most frightening detail surrounding the Grim Reaper's legend is its nature as a singular entity, for some believe that more than one exists in the Great Beyond. There are whispered rumors of a council of at least nine Grim Reapers, stalking reality and culling the living as in service to true entropy. According to the teachings of some death cults, the final goal of the Grim Reaper is to end the cycle of life and death and serve as a silent lord of an empty universe.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Undead](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=46)): DC 52\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 50\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 47\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Grim_Reaper.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 21\">[Grim Reaper](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3036)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Unique\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=723\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Undead\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=722\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Unholy\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=521\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 184 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +41; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59), see the unseen, status sight, [_truesight_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1727)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Necril](/Languages.aspx?ID=20)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +43, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +38, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +40, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +43, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +39, [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=14) +36, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +43\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** +10\r\n\r\n**Con** +8\r\n\r\n**Int** +5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +7\r\n\r\n**Cha** +8\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Status Sight** The Grim Reaper automatically knows the Hit Points, conditions, afflictions, and emotions of all creatures it can see.\r\n\r\n**Items**\r\n[Scythe](/Weapons.aspx?ID=39)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 47 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +37 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +41 \r\n\r\n**Will** +38 \r\n\r\n+1 status to all saves vs. [magic](/Traits.aspx?ID=644)\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 320\r\n(death's grace, [void healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=83))\n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\nbleed, [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=571) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=578), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=669), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nall damage 15\n\n**Aura of Misfortune** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=542), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [misfortune](/Traits.aspx?ID=654)) 20 feet.

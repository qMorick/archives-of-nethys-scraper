Nearly 100 feet tall, this massive stone statue typically resembles a stalwart warrior wearing only a loincloth and skullcap. Few have seen the entire body of a guthallath, though; most of the time, the relic is buried up to its neck, covered in moss, and stranded in a forgotten place. Yet every so often, one of these harbingers of destruction reactivates in response to some unknown stimulus or rallying call, and when this happens, woe to any who stand in its way.\n\n While a guthallath's ancient enemies are likely gone, it's still an engine of pure destruction, designed to rampage for weeks, even months. It's not intelligent enough to enjoy or regret its acts and cannot be reasoned with— it's also unaffected by most magic and unpredictable in how it selects its targets (and the creatures it spares).\n\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Construct](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=35), [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=37)): DC 44\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 42\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 39\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Guthallath.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 19\">[Guthallath](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3039)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=683\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Gargantuan\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Construct\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=563\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 187 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +30; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59), [_truesight_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1727)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +25, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +40\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +10\r\n\r\n**Dex** +2\r\n\r\n**Con** +8\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +0\r\n\r\n**Cha** -1\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 43 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +38 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +32 \r\n\r\n**Will** +30 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 325\n\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Immunities**\r\nbleed, [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=571) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=578), [doomed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=67), [drained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=68), [fatigued](/Conditions.aspx?ID=73), [healing](/Traits.aspx?ID=623), [nonlethal](/Traits.aspx?ID=661) attacks, [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=669), [sickened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=91), [spirit](/Traits.aspx?ID=737), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95), [vitality](/Traits.aspx?ID=509), [void](/Traits.aspx?ID=510)\r\n\r\n**Resistances**\r\nphysical 15 (except [adamantine](/Equipment.aspx?ID=374)), spells 15 (except [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=555), [earth](/Traits.aspx?ID=585), or [water](/Traits.aspx?ID=732))\n\n**Erosion Aura** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=542), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=676)) 120 feet.

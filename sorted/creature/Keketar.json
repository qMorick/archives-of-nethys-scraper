A keketar resembles a shimmering, serpentine creature with spines, claws, and a dragon-like head. A keketar's actual appearance is in constant flux, but they generally stay about 18 feet long with a weight of around 1,500 pounds. While their physical forms can vary, two things remain constant: first, a keketar's eyes are always a piercing shade of amber or violet. Second, the keketar's mark of office—a crown of shifting symbols that hovers above their head—never changes. A keketar cannot remove their crown but can suppress it, although most are loath to do so and consider such an act one of cowardice or shame.\n\n Keketars fill a role in protean society of a sort of priesthood, operating as intermediaries between the other proteans and the Speakers of the Depths. All other proteans defer to keketars, treating them in a way similar to how citizens of a mortal city would treat respected nobles; even more powerful proteans defer to the will of the keketars. As with many religions, dogma and theology are prone to interpretation and change, and among the proteans, the situation is even more pronounced. Whatever the nature and desires of the Speakers of the Depths may be, individual keketars often come to dramatically different conclusions as to their will and intent. To the proteans, however, this inherent dissonance is a strength rather than a weakness.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Monitor](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=46)): DC 36\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 34\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 31\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Keketar.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 17\">[Keketar](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3146)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Monitor\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=655\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Protean\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=678\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 272 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +30; entropy sense ([imprecise](/Rules.aspx?ID=412)) 60 feet, [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Chthonian](/Languages.aspx?ID=114), [Empyrean](/Languages.aspx?ID=115), [Protean](/Languages.aspx?ID=33); [telepathy](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=79) 100 feet, [_truespeech_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1728)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +26, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +33, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +32, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +34, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +34, [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) +30, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +30\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** +5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +7\r\n\r\n**Cha** +7\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Entropy Sense** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [prediction](/Traits.aspx?ID=674)) A protean can anticipate the most likely presence of a creature through a supernatural insight into chaotic probabilities and chance.

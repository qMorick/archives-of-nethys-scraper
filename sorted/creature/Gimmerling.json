These cruelly curious fey obsess over finding and making unusual traps and sadistic weapons, and their favorite amusement is seeing these traps sprung or the weapons wielded. When residing on Golarion, they're frequently found in urban areas, particularly slums or other parts of town, where they can either go unnoticed or be easily forgotten—and have plenty of victims to choose from.\n\n A typical gimmerling disguises themself as an endangered child, hoping to draw creatures close enough to rob. The gimmerling puts themself in apparent danger using a trap, construct, a bribed ally, or even a coerced monster.\n\n Because gimmerlings sometimes trade obscure smithing or trapping techniques in exchange for gifts that sate their curiosity, their greed, or their hunger, they have at times been worshipped as minor gods of the forge.

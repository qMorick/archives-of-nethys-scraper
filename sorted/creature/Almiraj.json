Though it shares this trait with the docile [unicorn](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=504), that's where their similarities end. Almirajes are vicious creatures, known to slaughter much larger cattle and, in times of desperation, people. Its stare is said to send even the bravest warrior running for their life.\n\n Unlike common hares, almirajes are solitary and intensely territorial. They're adaptable ambush hunters with the stamina and speed to chase down any prey. They attack with their jaws and claws but are primarily known for trying to gut their prey with a vicious stab from their horn. Many scholars believe that the terrifying magical aura the creatures exude originates from their horns. This line of thinking has led to an increase in almiraj attacks as local citizens try to capture the creature alive and remove the horn, hoping this will turn it into a more docile hare. These hopes have not proven fruitful, as an almiraj is just as aggressive, if not more so, after their horn has been removed.\n\n Adventurers often think themselves lucky if they manage to avoid the terrifying horn of this ferocious predator, but it's a much better alternative than being caught in its jaws. Almirajes have a nasty habit of grabbing their prey and vigorously shaking them until they go limp. If this fails, they'll drag their prey underground until they suffocate deep in the earth. Few have ever escaped the burrow of an almiraj.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Animal](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=43)): DC 21\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 16\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Almiraj.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 4\">[Almiraj](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3253)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=721\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Small\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Animal\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=531\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Howl of the Wild](/Sources.aspx?ID=226) pg. 124 <sup>2.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +14; [tremorsense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=82) ([imprecise](/Rules.aspx?ID=412)) 40 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=36) +13, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=48) +10, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=49) +8\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +5\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +4\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +0\r\n\r\n**Cha** +3\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 20 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +14 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +11 \r\n\r\n**Will** +8 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 63\n\n</row>\n\n**[Frightful Presence](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=64)** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=542), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=590), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=598), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647)) 5 feet, DC 22.

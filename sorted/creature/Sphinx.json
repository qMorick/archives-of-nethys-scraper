They are often maligned in legends as nothing more than monsters, and though they are quick to anger and are capable of exacting deadly retribution for perceived slights, they are also highly intelligent.\n\n Sphinxes are often associated with desert regions, but they can dwell in more moderate climates. They form small groups consisting of a single, extended family that hunts and works together to protect and teach their young. As they mature, sphinxes develop a drive to gather hidden lore and solve the world's greatest riddles—the trait that is perhaps most often identified with their kind.\n\n While sometimes bound into service as guardians for powerful spellcasters, lone sphinxes may also be encountered on journeys of discovery and as purveyors of esoteric lore. If treated with the proper respect—and fed well—a sphinx can demonstrate a willingness to exchange information. Their favorite currency is, of course, riddles and secrets. One who can trade knowledge for knowledge has a much better chance of succeeding while bargaining with a sphinx. However, a sphinx's insatiable thirst for new riddles, as well as their extensive collection of secrets accumulated over hundreds of years of life, makes it difficult to offer them something they don't already know. Those who attempt to trade petty insight and stale riddles may invoke a sphinx's ire and will not live long enough to regret it.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=35), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=43)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Humanoid](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=47)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Sphinx.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Sphinx](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3205)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=547\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=628\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 319 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +18; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59)\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1), [Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2), [Sphinx](/Languages.aspx?ID=35); [_truespeech_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1728)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) +17, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +18, [Bardic Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) +19, [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) +16, [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) +16, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +18, [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) +17\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +1\r\n\r\n**Con** +3\r\n\r\n**Int** +5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Bardic Lore** Sphinxes are naturally curious, and their love of puzzles and mysteries leads them to gather information on a broad range of topics.

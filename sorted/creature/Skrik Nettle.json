A fringe of brightly colored feathers circles their bodies, and long tendrils trail from their center, each ending in a snapping beak. Known for their eerie, chirping melodies, skrik nettles soar above the First World in flocks of a dozen or more, diligently scavenging for food in the fey realm's cutthroat ecosystem. When hunting or provoked, skrik nettles attack their foes by injecting them with a magical poison that causes the victim to float helplessly up into the sky. Skrik nettles continuously inject this poison into their helpless prey until it dies or is so high up that the skrik nettle needs only wait for the poison to end, its meal crashing helplessly to the ground below.\n\n Skrik nettles that find their way to the Material Plane (or any plane other than the First World, for that matter) tend to be much more aggressive, for the planar energies that they find comforting and soothing on the First World are conspicuously absent. The first few minutes after a skrik nettle arrives on any plane but the First World tend to be filled with violence and fear, as the panicking creature lashes out at any nearby creatures (including other skrik nettles) in the mistaken notion that these others are somehow responsible for the discomforting change. After 10 minutes or so, assuming the skrik nettle survives its bout of violence, the creature calms down somewhat and does its best to acclimate to its new home. Yet even skrik nettles who find themselves marooned beyond the First World for years never lose their longing for home, and they instinctively seek out portals to this plane for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Aberration](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11)): DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 20\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 17\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/SkrikNettle.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 6\">[Skrik Nettle](/Monsters.aspx?ID=804)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"N\" url=\"/Rules.aspx?ID=95\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Aberration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=1\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 242 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\n**Perception** +16; motionsense 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\n\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +16\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +4\r\n\r\n**Dex** +5\r\n\r\n**Con** +2\r\n\r\n**Int** -4\r\n\r\n**Wis** +4\r\n\r\n**Cha** +0\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Motionsense** A flying skrik nettle can detect the movement of nearby creatures and objects from the tiny gusts of wind created by their movements.

Desert drakes are nonetheless dangerous ambush predators, preying upon isolated desert travelers and outposts for food and supplies. Desert drakes' scales range in coloration from rust-brown to light tan and ocher shades, mimicking the colors of the dunes they call home.\n\n Like [frost drakes](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2962), a rampage of desert drakes often claims a huge span of territory, watching over an expanse of desert from a perch in nearby mountains or a nest among weathered ruins. Any creature visible on the surface is liable to be targeted by the drakes, especially humanoid caravans. Rampages along trade routes quickly learn to leave a member watching over each oasis for new prey. During especially lean times, the drakes will even dig out subterranean prey like [ankhravs](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=361), [giant scorpions](/Monsters.aspx?ID=356), or entire nests of [giant ants](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2824).\n\n Desert drakes are among the lightest and most compact of the drakes, though this shouldn't be mistaken for frailty. Their swooped-back horns and feather-thin wings are adapted to make burrowing as easy as possible. Indeed, a desert drake's powerful neck makes wriggling through sand and other loose scree as easy as walking for it.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Dragon](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=35)): DC 24\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 22\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 19\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Monsters/Desert_Drake.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 8\">[Desert Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2963)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Large\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Dragon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=581\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Earth\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=585\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 133 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Perception** +15; [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59), sandstorm sight, [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=74) ([imprecise](/Rules.aspx?ID=412)) 30 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Draconic](/Languages.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=1) +17, [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +18, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +13, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +15, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +15\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +6\r\n\r\n**Dex** +3\r\n\r\n**Con** +5\r\n\r\n**Int** -1\r\n\r\n**Wis** +3\r\n\r\n**Cha** +1\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n**Sandstorm Sight** Sandstorms don't impair a desert drake's vision; they ignore [concealment](/Conditions.aspx?ID=62)from sandstorms.

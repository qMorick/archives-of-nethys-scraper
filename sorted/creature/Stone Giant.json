They dwell in caves in tall mountains and craggy ranges, where their grayish skin allows them to blend in with their surroundings and go unnoticed, despite being around 12 feet tall. Benign travelers who come across a clan of stone giants need not worry, however, for stone giants do not actively invite confrontation or strife. They are, by and large, peaceful people who seek wisdom through exploration of nature and long meditations on the elements of the natural world. Their elders are among the wisest of giants, using their charisma and druidic magic to lead their clans to prosperity and harmony with nature.\n\n A stone giant clan will usually raise a number of animals as pets, favoring [cave bears](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2851), [elephants](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2993), or [dinosaurs](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=391) depending on the environment.

They look like large canines, though their coloration and features change as they exercise their powers over heat and cold. Depending on whether they've most recently unleashed their lunar or solar powers, bul-gaes resemble either a crimson hound wreathed in flames or a cerulean, frostbitten fox, respectively.\n\n Legends say that the first bul-gae attempted to steal the sun from the sky. As they bit down on the burning sphere, though, the bul-gae was badly burned. Having failed, they then tried to retrieve the moon, but when they touched the moon, the bul-gae froze solid and fell to the ground. The descendants of that bul-gae forever hone their powers of flame and ice so that they might one day succeed where their ancestor failed.\n\n Tales say that bul-gaes serve as faithful companions to the ancient, shadowy master of the first bul-gae. These stories purport that the shadow master can see through the distorted light of all bul-gaes and use the hounds as a means to watch the universe for unknown purposes.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**[Recall Knowledge - Beast](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**\r\n([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10)): DC 32\r\n\r\n**[Unspecific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 30\r\n\r\n**[Specific Lore](/Rules.aspx?ID=563)**: DC 27\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature 14\">[Bul-Gae](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2767)</title>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Medium\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Cold\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=27\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Fire\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=72\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Source** [Tian Xia World Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=223) pg. 282\n\n**Perception** +26; [greater darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12), [scent](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=33) (imprecise) 60 feet\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\n[Tien](/Languages.aspx?ID=43)\r\n\r\n**Skills**\r\n[Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) +28, [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7) +23, [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) +23, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) +25\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Str** +8\r\n\r\n**Dex** +4\r\n\r\n**Con** +7\r\n\r\n**Int** +5\r\n\r\n**Wis** +6\r\n\r\n**Cha** +4\r\n</row>\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**AC** 33 \r\n\r\n**Fort** +28 \r\n\r\n**Ref** +22 \r\n\r\n**Will** +25 \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**HP** 255\n\n</row>\n\n**Resistances**\r\ncold 15, fire 15\n\n**Eclipse Aura** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=542), [darkness](/Traits.aspx?ID=569), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=662)) 100 feet.

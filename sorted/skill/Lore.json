For instance, you couldn't choose Magic Lore to recall the breadth of knowledge about magic covered by [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10), [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11), and [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13), or choose Adventuring Lore to give you all the information an adventurer needs, or choose Planar Lore to gain all the information spread across various skills and subcategories such as Heaven Lore.\n\n If you're making a check and multiple subcategories of Lore could apply, or a non-Lore skill could apply, you can use whichever skill you prefer. If there's any doubt whether a Lore skill applies to a specific topic or action, the GM decides whether it can be used or not.

Most Athletics actions let you move about the environment ([Climb](/Actions.aspx?ID=33), [High Jump](/Actions.aspx?ID=36), [Long Jump](/Actions.aspx?ID=37), [Swim](/Actions.aspx?ID=39)) or control your opponent's movement in combat ([Grapple](/Actions.aspx?ID=35), Reposition, [Shove](/Actions.aspx?ID=38), [Trip](/Actions.aspx?ID=40), and [Disarm](/Actions.aspx?ID=41)). [Escape](/Actions.aspx?ID=79): When you use the Escape basic action, you can use your Athletics modifier instead of your unarmed attack modifier.\n\n<title level=\"3\">Multiple Attacks with Athletics</title> Several Athletics actions have the [attack](/Traits.aspx?ID=15) trait, meaning that using them more than once in the same turn makes them less accurate. Since these actions use your free hand, you use the traits for your fist attack to determine the multiple attack penalty, so your fist's [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) trait applies. Therefore, you take a –4 penalty if the action is your second attack of the turn, or a –8 if it's the third. Some weapon traits allow you to take these actions using a weapon, in which case the penalty might be –5 or –10 if the weapon doesn't have the agile trait. Some characters can get unarmed attacks without the agile trait as well. If it's unclear which penalty to use, the GM makes the call.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Item Bonuses for Athletics</title>\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Item</th>\r\n<th>Bonus</th>\r\n<th>Level</th>\r\n<th>Category</th>\r\n<th>Consumable</th>\r\n<th>Note</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>[Mariner's Splint](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3274)</td>\r\n<td>+1</td>\r\n<td>5</td>\r\n<td>[Armor](/equipment/armor)</td>\r\n<td>No</td>\r\n<td>Athletics checks toClimb or Swim</td>\r\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\r\n<td>[Trudd's strength](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3771)</td>\r\n<td>+1</td>\r\n<td>5</td>\r\n<td>[Clan Dagger Filigrees](/equipment/runes/clan-dagger-filigrees)</td>\r\n<td>No</td>\r\n<td>Item bonus to Athletics checks</td>\r\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\r\n<td>[Bronze Bull Pendant](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2966)</td>\r\n<td>+1</td>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td>[Talismans](/equipment/consumables/talismans)</td>\r\n<td>Yes</td>\r\n<td>Athletics to Shove</td>\r\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\r\n<td>[Monkey Pin](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2985)</td>\r\n<td>+1</td>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td>[Talismans](/equipment/consumables/talismans)</td>\r\n<td>Yes</td>\r\n<td>Athletics to Climb</td>\r\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\r\n<td>[Savior Spike](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2991)</td>\r\n<td>+1</td>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td>[Talismans](/equipment/consumables/talismans)</td>\r\n<td>Yes</td>\r\n<td>Athletics to Grab an Edge</td>\r\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\r\n<td>[Mantis Embrace](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3496)</td>\r\n<td>+2</td>\r\n<td>0</td>\r\n<td>[Other Worn Items](/equipment/worn-items/other-worn-items)</td>\r\n<td>No</td>\r\n<td>Athletics checks to Grapple or Shove</td>\r\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\r\n<td>[Zarothrask's Contract](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3578)</td>\r\n<td>+2</td>\r\n<td>9</td>\r\n<td>[Other Contracts](/equipment/contracts/other-contracts)</td>\r\n<td>No</td>\r\n<td>Disarm manufactured items and to Grapple</td>\r\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\r\n<td>[Fire-Jump Ring](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3433)</td>\r\n<td>+2</td>\r\n<td>10</td>\r\n<td>[Worn Items](/equipment/worn-items)</td>\r\n<td>No</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\r\n<td>[Sash of Prowess](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3439)</td>\r\n<td>+2</td>\r\n<td>10</td>\r\n<td>[Worn Items](/equipment/worn-items)</td>\r\n<td>No</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\r\n<td>[greater Trudd's strength](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3771)</td>\r\n<td>+2</td>\r\n<td>11</td>\r\n<td>[Clan Dagger Filigrees](/equipment/runes/clan-dagger-filigrees)</td>\r\n<td>No</td>\r\n<td>Item bonus to Athletics checks</td>\r\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\r\n<td>[Sash of Prowess (Greater)](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3439)</td>\r\n<td>+2</td>\r\n<td>17</td>\r\n<td>[Worn Items](/equipment/worn-items)</td>\r\n<td>No</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\r\n<td>[Jaws of the Grogrisant](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3780)</td>\r\n<td>+3</td>\r\n<td>17</td>\r\n<td>[Apex Items](/equipment/apex-items)</td>\r\n<td>No</td>\r\n<td>Item bonus to Perception checks to Athletics</td>\r\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\r\n<td>[Golden Gloves](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3647)</td>\r\n<td>+3</td>\r\n<td>19</td>\r\n<td>[Apex Items](/equipment/apex-items)</td>\r\n<td>No</td>\r\n<td>item bonus to Athletics checks</td>\r\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\r\n<td>[Vyre's Bliss](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3642)</td>\r\n<td>+3</td>\r\n<td>20</td>\r\n<td>[Alchemical Poisons](/equipment/alchemical-items/alchemical-poisons)</td>\r\n<td>Yes</td>\r\n<td>item bonus to Athletics checks and Fortitude saves for 1 hour if applied to an elixir or potion.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Related Feats</title>\r\n\r\nTo see a list of Feats related to Athletics, [click here](/feats?include-traits=skill&amp;exclude-traits=archetype&amp;include-skills=athletics&amp;sort=level-asc%3Bname-asc).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Athletics Untrained Actions</title>\r\n\r\n<document level=\"3\" id=\"action-2374\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"3\" id=\"action-2375\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"3\" id=\"action-2376\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"3\" id=\"action-2377\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"3\" id=\"action-2378\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"3\" id=\"action-2379\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"3\" id=\"action-2380\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"3\" id=\"action-2381\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"3\" id=\"action-2382\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Athletics Trained Actions</title>\r\n\r\n<document level=\"3\" id=\"action-2383\" />",

She embodies two aspects halflings see in themselves: a strong affinity for luck and a bold determination to protect friends. Chaldira is hotheaded and cannot abide bullies in any form, and many of her worshippers are similarly impetuous, spoiling for any opportunity to leap fist-first at oppressors and tyrants. While many people consider this to be more of a vice than a virtue, Chaldira and her followers feel it is far better to run headlong into trouble than it is to meekly concede to evil out of fear or convenience. Chaldira is also the goddess of light-hearted mischief, insisting that harmless fun, even at others’ expense, brings joy and strengthens ties within a community. While not all of Chaldira’s followers are inveterate pranksters, most at least know some sleight-of-hand tricks. \n\nChaldira is most often depicted as a [halfling](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=63) woman who matches the appearance of the local halfling community, with curly hair, freckles, and a patchwork red-and-green coat held together by several mismatched buttons. She is infamous for charging into situations with very little planning, trusting her indomitable spirit and lucky nature to see her through. So far, this has always worked out for the deity, if not always for her followers—a quirk that tends to infuriate more tactically-minded gods. \n\nChaldira’s church is very casual, with few formal priests; most congregations are led by lay priests who pursue a full-time job and work hard to preserve halfling customs, strengthen ties between neighbors, and lift the underprivileged in the community out of poverty. True clerics of Chaldira are responsible for running the church as a whole, as well as petitioning secular leadership for further laws that promote equality. Many Chaldirans support the Bellflower Network, a clandestine organization that labors to free halflings from slavery throughout the Inner Sea region, but principally in Cheliax.\n\nChaldira is a common companion of [Desna](/Deities.aspx?ID=281), but she considers herself a close friend of nearly all non-evil gods and delights in telling exaggerated tales of their escapades, particularly when such tales involve mischief or embarrassing situations. Even reserved deities such as [Erastil](/Deities.aspx?ID=282) or [Irori](/Deities.aspx?ID=286) often find themselves pulled into adventures by the irrepressibly friendly goddess— whether they like it or not.\n\nChaldira’s chief foe among the gods is [Thamir](/Deities.aspx?ID=158), an evil god venerated by desperate and misanthropic halflings. Divine scholars nonetheless note the two deities share many common traits: most notably a habit of solving their issues with violence, but also an impulsive nature, a love of mischief, and a preference toward the underdog. Followers of Chaldira do not shy away from the comparison, instead recognizing the similarities and trying to prevent the bitterness that can draw people into Thamir’s fold.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Other Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** seek out and challenge oppressors and tyrants, defend friends and the innocent, engage in mischief that doesn’t harm others\r\n\r\n**Anathema** suffer a bully’s insult to you or another without retort, abandon a friend in need, attribute a lucky turn of events to your own skill\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nbattle, fortune, mischief\n\n**Pantheons**\r\n[Fortune's Fate](/Deities.aspx?ID=378)\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nDexterity or Charisma\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=50)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Shortsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=398)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Confidence](/Domains.aspx?ID=67), [Luck](/Domains.aspx?ID=81), [Trickery](/Domains.aspx?ID=94), [Zeal](/Domains.aspx?ID=100)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Freedom](/Domains.aspx?ID=77)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Fleet Step](/Spells.aspx?ID=1531)\n\n- **2nd**\r\n[Laughing Fit](/Spells.aspx?ID=1583)\n\n- **5th**\r\n[Cloak of Colors](/Spells.aspx?ID=1977)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nThe Calamitous Turn’s pleasure most often manifests as improbably good luck, while her displeasure creates startling misfortune. \r\n\r\n**Source** [Gods &amp; Magic - Web Supplement](/Sources.aspx?ID=19) pg. 5\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**Minor Boon** Once, you can choose the result of the next ordinary coin you flip or ordinary die you roll.

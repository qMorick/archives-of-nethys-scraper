Depicted as a tengu with smoking black feathers and a nine- ring sword in his claws, Hei Feng is the lord of storms and possesses a temperament as volatile as the raging sea. He boasts a vast array of followers in Kwanlai, where the tengu population has constructed hundreds of statues venerating him along the coast. Smaller figures have also been erected as odes to his four retainers—the Counts of Wind, Rain, Thunder, and Lightning. Outside of Kwanlai, temples dedicated to Hei Feng are present in nearly all of Tian Xia's seaside communities.\n\n Hei Feng does not hide his emotions, and his profanity-laced battle cries, passionate praises of street performances, and cackles of glee while imbibing copious amounts of alcohol are legendary. Instead of agonizing over the unpredictability of existence, worshippers of Hei Feng mimic their god's lust for life, grasping every moment and fully devoting themselves to their passions.\n\n One of the most prominent displays of this fervor occurs in Kwanlai during the Festival of Sea to Sky, a Tian holiday celebrating the Duke of Thunder. During the festival, Hei Fengans parade along the coast, hoisting palanquins bearing cloth and paper figures of Hei Feng and his four retainers above their heads. At every statue and shrine devoted to their god and his entourage, festival participants offer both loud prayers and sips of cloudless lightning, a potent rice liquor renowned for burning throats. Once everyone is properly tipsy, worshippers scatter firecrackers along the road and proceed to march through the explosions. Injuries ranging from singed eyebrows to painful burns are usually endured during this ritual, but to Hei Fengans, the Festival of Sea to Sky is the purest means of celebrating their god's fiery personality. Furthermore, Hei Feng always rewards the most fervent festival participants with fair weather during their next sea voyage.\n\n The Duke of Thunder's faithful wander far and wide, making them common fixtures of both adventuring groups and Tian Xia folklore. Curiously, Hei Fengans are also known for their extraordinarily polite behavior toward the temples and worshippers of Lady Jingxi, Hei Feng's estranged wife. While Hei Feng was never a loving husband, rumor has it that anyone who disrespects Lady Jingxi will face the full extent of the storm god's wrath.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Tian Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** follow your passions, make token attempts to apologize to those you have wronged, respect the power of the sea and sky, encourage flashy entertainment\r\n\r\n**Anathema** fake friendship with those you despise; disrespect Hei Feng or Hei Feng’s estranged wife Lady Jingxi; ignore an affront to you, Hei Feng, or Lady Jingxi\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nsea, storms, tengu, sailors\n\n**Pantheons**\r\n[Weight Of The World](/Deities.aspx?ID=384)\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nConstitution or Charisma\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) or [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=45)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Jiu Huan Dao](/Weapons.aspx?ID=288)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Air](/Domains.aspx?ID=65), [Indulgence](/Domains.aspx?ID=79), [Lightning](/Domains.aspx?ID=111), [Water](/Domains.aspx?ID=98)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Destruction](/Domains.aspx?ID=71), [Travel](/Domains.aspx?ID=93)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Gust of Wind](/Spells.aspx?ID=1550)\n\n- **4th**\r\n[Hydraulic Torrent](/Spells.aspx?ID=1562)\n\n- **6th**\r\n[Chain Lightning](/Spells.aspx?ID=1462)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Thunder’s intercessions are seen more commonly than other deities’ because of the god’s closeness to mortals, but also because of his tendency to dispense both boons and curses while in the depths of his drink.\r\n\r\n**Source** [Gods &amp; Magic - Web Supplement](/Sources.aspx?ID=19) pg. 7\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**Minor Boon** The Heavenly Court’s most boastful deity ensures your boasts hit home.

Even the crudest artistic awakenings are worthy of praise in the goddess’s eyes, as they represent an individual’s expression of life’s trials and triumphs. She believes every creature is worthy of love and capable of creating art in their own way. Shelyn’s religion does not require chastity, fidelity, or a particular relationship structure, as the passion of early romance is a facet of love just as important and valid as the comfortable trust between a long-married couple. However, she does make the distinction between courtship and pure carnal desire, and she prefers that trysts blossom into more meaningful relationships along the way.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Gods of the Inner Sea](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** be peaceful, choose and perfect an art, lead by example, see the beauty in all things\r\n\r\n**Anathema** destroy art or allow it to be destroyed, unless saving a life or pursuing greater art; refuse to accept surrender\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nart, beauty, love, and music\n\n**Pantheons**\r\n[Guardians Of The Sacred Self](/Deities.aspx?ID=379), [Radiant Prism](/Deities.aspx?ID=380), [The Enlightened Scholar's Path](/Deities.aspx?ID=251), [The Prismatic Ray](/Deities.aspx?ID=207), [The Resplendent Court](/Deities.aspx?ID=272)\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Deities/Shelyn.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nWisdom or Charisma\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=37)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Glaive](/Weapons.aspx?ID=375)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Creation](/Domains.aspx?ID=68), [Family](/Domains.aspx?ID=74), [Passion](/Domains.aspx?ID=88), [Protection](/Domains.aspx?ID=90)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Repose](/Domains.aspx?ID=116)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Dizzying Colors](/Spells.aspx?ID=1500)\n\n- **3rd**\r\n[Enthrall](/Spells.aspx?ID=1516)\n\n- **4th**\r\n[Creation](/Spells.aspx?ID=1477)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nWhen creatures perform pleasing acts, such as spreading beauty, or displeasing actions, such as betraying loved ones, Shelyn may respond accordingly.\r\n\r\n**Source** [Gods &amp; Magic](/Sources.aspx?ID=17) pg. 45 <sup>2.0</sup>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**Minor Boon** Once, when you roll a failure on a [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6) check, you get a critical success instead.

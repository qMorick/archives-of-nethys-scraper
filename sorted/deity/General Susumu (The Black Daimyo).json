A weapon is a tool to kill, and violence a means of subjugation. The ultimate power is found at the tip of an arrow or the edge of a sword, and the ultimate glory is found in the churned, bloody mud of a battlefield. Anything more is just words.\n\n Just as his half-sister Shizuru represents light and righteousness, General Susumu represents the seething darkness of pride and ambition. He recruits those who find Shizuru's gracious code of conduct too strict and impractical in a world with real battles and monsters. Once lured, General Susumu deftly feeds into this follower's desires for new meaning in their lives by indoctrinating them into the path of war and glory at all costs. As such, General Susumu is the patron of fallen samurai, and constantly seeks to stoke the hubris that hides within even the most stalwart of hearts. Though he has little concern for his victims or even his subordinates, Susumu has his pride as a warrior, and those who wish to keep his favor must have the same. The tools of battle—mighty weapons and well-trained steeds—are essential and must be well treated; abuse of either is both shortsighted and contemptible. Lands and strongholds must be defended, not out of any duty to their people, but because their loss is a blemish on their lord's reputation. A follower of Susumu must always be willing to stand up to any challenge and prove their worth.\n\n General Susumu is a skilled leader who seeks victory and glory in battle, regardless of the cost. His troops are oblivious to any innocent bystanders as they charge to engage the enemy, and his officers are unconcerned about any collateral damage their armies may cause to cities or villages. Foes who see Susumu's symbol emblazoned on their enemy's battle standards often drop their weapons and run rather than face the General's onslaught.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Tian Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** seek glory in battle, loudly proclaim your victories, protect your possessions and strongholds\r\n\r\n**Anathema** cower from fights, refuse a challenge from an equal, mistreat your weapons, abuse your mount\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nfear, glory, warfare, death\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nStrength or Dexterity\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=36)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Longbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=436) or [Shortbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=437)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Confidence](/Domains.aspx?ID=67), [Destruction](/Domains.aspx?ID=71), [Might](/Domains.aspx?ID=83), [Zeal](/Domains.aspx?ID=100)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** \r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Sure Strike](/Spells.aspx?ID=1709)\n\n- **3rd**\r\n[Wall of Wind](/Spells.aspx?ID=1753)\n\n- **4th**\r\n[Weapon Storm](/Spells.aspx?ID=1758)\n\n</column>",

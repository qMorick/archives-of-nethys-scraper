Yet the duality of [Gozreh](/Deities.aspx?ID=8) and the sustainability and care of [Ylimancha](/Deities.aspx?ID=132) round out this pantheon. The Wind and the Waves and the Harborwing strive for safety and balance between air, land, and sea, and it's for their care that many a frightened, storm- tossed seafarer prays during a perilous journey. Followers of this pantheon aren't given to regular worship unless to utter a simple prayer or recitation on the bow of a ship at sea. Instead, the faithful find themselves most pious when the winds, waves, and thunder are in full force, threatening the survival of the ship, or when they pull into harbor after safely enduring a storm. At such times, joyous celebrations of dancing, singing, and pouring out libations to their gods mark their worship. Faithful followers are also committed to rescuing those at sea and have been known to sail into terrifying storms in search of the stranded.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Pantheons](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=18)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** give thanks for safe passage, respect the sea, view all storms with optimism and perseverance\r\n\r\n**Anathema** put off travel until there are calm waters, refuse aid to those stranded at sea, stay too long on land\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\ncoastlines, the sea, seafarers, storms\r\n\r\n**Follower Alignments**\r\nNG, N, CG, CN\n\n**Pantheon Members**\r\n[Gozreh](/Deities.aspx?ID=284)\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nConstitution or Wisdom\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) or [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Rapier](/Weapons.aspx?ID=36)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Nature](/Domains.aspx?ID=22), [Travel](/Domains.aspx?ID=30), [Trickery](/Domains.aspx?ID=31), [Water](/Domains.aspx?ID=35)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** \r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Gust of Wind](/Spells.aspx?ID=143)\n\n- **3rd**\r\n[Feet to Fins](/Spells.aspx?ID=113)\n\n- **5th**\r\n[Control Water](/Spells.aspx?ID=51)\n\n</column>",

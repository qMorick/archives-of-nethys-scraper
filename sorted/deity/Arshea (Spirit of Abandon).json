More than anything else, freedom is what matters to Arshea. For many this is most commonly seen as freedom for sexual expression, but Arshea represents the freedom to experience all that is good in the world, be it an ideology or a specific emotional or physical expression. So long as it doesn’t harm others, Arshea believes creatures should do, think, and feel as they will. They encourage their followers to try new things, to think in new ways, and to wear new forms. \n\nWhen appearing to mortals, the Spirit of Abandon most commonly appears in that person’s own body so the person can see how beautiful and perfect their own form is—after all, if a divine being has chosen to wear it, it must be perfect.

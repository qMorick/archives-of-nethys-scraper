Some believe she was a construct who achieved consciousness and a spark of divinity, while others think she was a human alchemist and inventor who discovered ways to fuse mechanical components with her own physiology. Regardless of her origins, Brigh is a patient and thoughtful god who promotes unending curiosity and constant intellectual advancement. Her two most common forms are a humanoid woman made of bronze clockwork and a human woman wearing a bronze skullcap and armor composed of gears and other movable metal pieces. Though Brigh’s usual demeanor is composed and reserved, she isn’t an unfeeling automaton; she deeply cherishes the creations she and her followers make, and most of her worshippers feel the same way. \n\nBrigh’s faith isn’t as widespread as that of most other gods, though she does have pockets of worship in areas where machinery and constructs are common. Among these are Alkenstar, where much of that city’s production of firearms is overseen by priests of Brigh; Numeria, where the proliferation of strange technological artifacts draws followers of the Whisper in Bronze like moths to a flame; and Absalom, where the mysterious Clockwork Cathedral teaches the crafts of mechanical engineering and construct-building to eager students. Brigh encourages her faithful to improve upon the work of others and allow others to build on their own achievements in Brigh turn. Typical followers of Brigh are those who work with their hands, especially gem cutters, inventors, and toy makers. Numerous gnomes are drawn to her religion, thanks to its emphasis on searching for new and exciting innovations. Many of her followers dedicate their lives to research and projects of great scope, crafting magnificent inventions that take years to create. Other followers are content with creating smaller inventions or tinkering with those of others. Brigh is pleased regardless of the size of the project, so long as new technologies and discoveries result from the work.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Other Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** craft new creations, pay attention to details, share achievements\r\n\r\n**Anathema** carelessly destroy others’ creations or research, enslave intelligent constructs, abuse constructs, refuse to acknowledge or learn from mistakes\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nclockwork, invention, time\n\n**Pantheons**\r\n[Wheels Of Innovation](/Deities.aspx?ID=385)\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nIntelligence or Wisdom\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) or [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy or unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=37)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Light Hammer](/Weapons.aspx?ID=384)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Creation](/Domains.aspx?ID=68), [Knowledge](/Domains.aspx?ID=80), [Metal](/Domains.aspx?ID=112), [Time](/Domains.aspx?ID=121)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Earth](/Domains.aspx?ID=73), [Fire](/Domains.aspx?ID=76)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Temporary Tool](/Spells.aspx?ID=2369)\n\n- **4th**\r\n[Creation](/Spells.aspx?ID=1477)\n\n- **7th**\r\n[Duplicate Foe](/Spells.aspx?ID=1505)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nThe Whisper in Bronze doesn’t dole out punishments or rewards to her followers lightly.\r\n\r\n**Source** [Gods &amp; Magic - Web Supplement](/Sources.aspx?ID=19) pg. 4\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**Minor Boon** Knowledge floods your mind.

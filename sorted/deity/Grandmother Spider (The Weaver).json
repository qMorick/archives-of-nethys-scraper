Infuriated at her position as a lackey, she made fools of the greater gods through mischief and disruption. She stole and copied [Asmodeus](/Deities.aspx?ID=278)’ keys, resulting in widespread chaos, and pilfered some of Sarenrae’s fire, leading numerous followers astray. Nimbly avoiding any retribution for her antics, Grandmother Spider rewove the strands of fate for herself, gaining her freedom. She regularly pleads with her brother [Achaekek](/Deities.aspx?ID=325) to follow her lead and rebel against the gods, and while he always refuses, seemingly indifferent, Achaekek has on one notable occasion proven vengeful toward those who harm his sister or her followers.\n\nGrandmother Spider is more of a folk hero than a god to many of her adherents. The Weaver tumbles messily through life, tricking those who underestimate her yet being tricked by those she underestimates in turn. She is driven to meddle by her curiosity and her impetuousness, not by any grand plan—and her schemes succeed or backfire as they may. Grandmother Spider rolls with the punches, as either result is a reward fairly earned, and expects those who follow her to do the same. To Grandmother Spider, failure is just as important as success, and the Weaver holds little love for those who can’t admit their own follies. \n\nDespite her antics, Grandmother Spider is a source of stability to most of her communities. She emphasizes the importance of family and community in a harsh world that is often unfair. She insists that people get what they deserve, whether it is kindness for kindness or vengeance for cruelty. Exploitation and predation earn her outrage. Many women and midwives are drawn to her faith, and the faith lauds their hard work and strength of character. Adherents also run a series of “Mama Schools” throughout the Mwangi Expanse, educating youths during the months between planting and harvesting. \n\nDue to the ongoing animosity of Asmodeus, worship of Grandmother Spider is virtually unknown in Avistan. She is traditionally revered in Garund and among anadi, whose ancestors she led through the darkness and into freedom. Temples are rarely dedicated to Grandmother Spider. Her places of worship are instead typically schools and small roadside or home shrines consisting of a spider figurine, a loom, or a woven object. Woven diamond shapes, patterned after Grandmother Spider’s religious symbol, can also be found tucked inside the temples of other deities, especially those belonging to the Ascended—those gods who were once mortal.\n\nGrandmother Spider emphasizes self-reliance, learning, cunning, and caring for family and community. The concept of unquestioning faith in a god is something Grandmother Spider sees as insufferably pretentious, though her own vanity is notorious. She is likewise intolerant of bullying and slavery and disdains inherited hierarchy and titles.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Other Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** be skilled and clever, think for yourself, take due payment for your work, humiliate the powerful\r\n\r\n**Anathema** abuse someone you have power over, harm someone who has given you sincere kindness, let a slight go unanswered, own a slave\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nfamily, illusion, stories, twilight, weaving\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nIntelligence or Wisdom\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) or [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=37)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Bola](/Weapons.aspx?ID=433)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Creation](/Domains.aspx?ID=68), [Family](/Domains.aspx?ID=74), [Fate](/Domains.aspx?ID=75), [Trickery](/Domains.aspx?ID=94)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Change](/Domains.aspx?ID=102), [Darkness](/Domains.aspx?ID=69)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Pest Form](/Spells.aspx?ID=1626)\n\n- **2nd**\r\n[Web](/Spells.aspx?ID=2045)\n\n- **4th**\r\n[Honeyed Words](/Spells.aspx?ID=1558)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nThough the Weaver often condones bad decisions so long as a lesson is learned, and is even willing to accept being fairly tricked herself, cruelty and predation upon the weak draw her outrage.\r\n\r\n**Source** [Gods &amp; Magic - Web Supplement](/Sources.aspx?ID=19) pg. 5\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**Minor Boon** Grandmother Spider rescues your prank from the jaws of failure.

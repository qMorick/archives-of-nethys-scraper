The governor selfishly sought her immortality, however, and tried to bury her alive. Transforming into her full dragon form, she set him, their home, and the surrounding land ablaze. After surviving the disaster, Lady Nanbyo came to love another man, but this one was unkind and harmful too. Her next lover, and the next, all followed this pattern of selfishness and greed, and so every lover met a tragic end. In her grief, vengeance and anger grew in her, until they consumed her and allowed her wrath to harness the power of natural disasters. Lady Nanbyo, or the Widow of Suffering, is the goddess of earthquakes, plagues, fires, and other calamities. She can appear to others as a graceful woman, shapeshifting into a vicious black-scaled sovereign dragon with over a dozen legs.\n\n It was Lady Nanbyo's cunning that allowed her to ascend to the celestial court, disguising herself in a storm created by Hei Feng. Fearful of her chaotic motives and mastery of strife, many deities try to distract her with games, cute animals, and companionship—usually unsuccessfully. She easily sees through their ruses and slips away, adding death, suffering, and destruction to the volcanic eruptions by Yamatsumi or tsunamis caused by Hei Feng. Integral to the constant reshaping of Tian Xia's environment and society, she contributed to the devastating fall of the Lung Wa empire, the eruption of Mount Pho-Yim in Tang Mai in 7099 ic, and the eruption of Mount Shibotai in Minata during the Shu empire that caused widespread drought, pests, and earthquakes.\n\n Those who fear her wrath and destruction pray to her to prevent calamity, but those who reverently worship her are usually disenchanted by society and look to cleanse anew with destruction and anarchy. The sudden emergence of yakshas, guardian spirits manifested to protect against the destruction of habitats and people, can often be a sign of Lady Nanbyo's forthcoming doom of an area.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Tian Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** revel in destruction, make natural disasters worse, allow natural disasters to take their due\r\n\r\n**Anathema** allow a natural disaster to completely destroy a community or leave a group with no survivors\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nearthquakes, plagues, fire, suffering\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nStrength or Constitution\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** must choose unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=43)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Warhammer](/Weapons.aspx?ID=403)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Destruction](/Domains.aspx?ID=71), [Fire](/Domains.aspx?ID=76), [Plague](/Domains.aspx?ID=115), [Water](/Domains.aspx?ID=98)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Dust](/Domains.aspx?ID=107), [Earth](/Domains.aspx?ID=73), [Lightning](/Domains.aspx?ID=111), [Sorrow](/Domains.aspx?ID=117)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Breathe Fire](/Spells.aspx?ID=1457)\n\n- **5th**\r\n[Control Water](/Spells.aspx?ID=1473)\n\n- **6th**\r\n[Phantasmal Calamity](/Spells.aspx?ID=1630)\n\n</column>",

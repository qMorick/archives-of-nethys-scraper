Noble, kind, and a leader by example, Sturovenen’s worship spread quickly and he ascended to full godhood in astonishingly short order.

Though Chakli’s life was short even by mortal standards, he lived to choose an heir who became Sturovenen’s next god caller and that tradition carried on generation after generation. It became a teaching among Sturovenen’s god callers that they had a responsibility to the Dragoneagle to ensure that he never lacked a mortal companion to preach wisdom and patience, for Sturovenen’s selflessness was well-known and an ancient prophecy spoken by the spirit guide Fox foretold that the very traits which made the Dragoneagle so well-loved would one day be his undoing. The god callers shared the duty of looking out for Sturovenen with his dawn-feathered children, the offspring of Sturovenen and Canary, many of whom took on god callers of their own and became quite famous among the people of Sarkoris outside of their father’s great shadow.\n\nSadly, Fox’s foretelling proved correct when the Godsrain struck Sarkoris. With the walls between planes already thin and damaged, [demonic](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=387) hordes sought to reopen the Worldwound and Sturovenen, accompanied by his last god caller and his many dawn-feathered children, flew to the nation’s defense.

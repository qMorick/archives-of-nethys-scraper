Unexpected but always appreciated, his arrival in a town is heralded by the sound of jingling coins. For a few days, the town bursts into smiles as a thousand joys big and small fall into place—a sale may go well, a baby may be born strong and healthy, the skies may clear just for the night of a festival—and then Kofusachi heads down the road once more, banks, storehouses, and hearts a little fuller than before.\n\n Kofusachi is the god of prosperity and happiness, which he and his faithful see as distinct but intertwined. While he knows better than to teach that coins can buy joy outright, he knows that one's laughter can be drowned out by the growling of a starving stomach. Kofusachi sees it as his mission to bring both abundance and joy to as many as possible, usually by connecting people and their desires: he'll nudge a wealthy but hungry merchant toward a poor but talented chef's new restaurant or push two shy neighbors together at a local dance.\n\n For all his generosity, Kofusachi is somewhat flighty, as no sooner has he found one happiness than his eyes turn to the horizon for the next. Shelyn in particular sometimes chides Kofusachi for his list of short-term lovers, which includes numerous deities and mortals of all genders, backgrounds, and walks of life. His only true companion is his traveling hound, Namsoon, a boisterous jindo whose fur shines no matter how many ditches he rolls in.\n\n Following their deity's example, Kofusachi's clergy are mostly wandering or itinerant monks, with little formal structure. Many towns have a small travel hut that Kofusachans maintain and leave unlocked, cleaning it and leaving behind nonperishable food and seven coins for anyone who needs them.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Tian Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** support local businesses, bring prosperity to your community, sample life’s pleasures\r\n\r\n**Anathema** become tied to one location, judge another based on sexual desires or gender roles, harm innocents, spread despair, commit murder\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nabundance, discovery, happiness, prosperity\n\n**Pantheons**\r\n[Fortune's Fate](/Deities.aspx?ID=378)\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nDexterity or Constitution\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=45)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Staff](/Weapons.aspx?ID=367)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Luck](/Domains.aspx?ID=81), [Passion](/Domains.aspx?ID=88), [Travel](/Domains.aspx?ID=93), [Wealth](/Domains.aspx?ID=99)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Fate](/Domains.aspx?ID=75)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Soothe](/Spells.aspx?ID=1678)\n\n- **2nd**\r\n[Laughing Fit](/Spells.aspx?ID=1583)\n\n- **8th**\r\n[Uncontrollable Dance](/Spells.aspx?ID=1730)\n\n</column>",

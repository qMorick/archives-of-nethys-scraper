His form resembles that of a giant mosquito, warped and distended by the parasites he hosts. He leaves malaise in his wake, laying waste to everything he can. Ghlaunder revels in suffering, especially that caused by sickness: the last gasp of air into fluid-filled lungs, the terrorizing dreams that come only from the hottest of fevers. It is said that the Gossamer King was once swaddled in a cocoon, but was released by the curious Desna into the world with a cleave of her starknife. Since then, the goddess has pursued him in a macabre dance, hoping to kill him as they flit between planes.\n\nGhlaunder draws in those cast aside by their kin. His priests are survivors of virulent childhood illnesses that left them changed and embittered, or those who have suffered gruesome tortures or terrible torments at the hands of inexperienced healers and wish to subject others to the same. He attracts misanthropes who wish to spread sickness, drawing from ostracized lepers, those injured and infected in war, and those riddled with pox. Ghlaunder tasks his followers with spreading sickness wherever they go, whether via an illness that they carry themselves or a plague they introduce by other means. Those who speak of him with reverence do so in hushed tones, and their foes include the likes of doctors, midwives, and followers of the goddess [Desna](/Deities.aspx?ID=281).\n\nThe adoration of Ghlaunder’s acolytes is disturbing to witness. They gather together away from prying eyes and wail to their god, bringing him offerings of rancid meat and fetid bodies, then infesting themselves with leeches and parasites. Ghlaunder’s desires are clear: he wants nothing more than to hear cries of anguish in the night when he hovers in the sky, knowing those who suffer below him are rotting from the inside out. \n\nPriests of Ghlaunder have shown an unusual interest in the Sarkoris Scar following the events of the Godsrain. [Gorum](/Deities.aspx?ID=283)’s death, specifically, likely has little to do with this directly, but it is possible that a near re-opening of the Worldwound, avoided only by the death of the Sarkorian god [Sturovenen](/Deities.aspx?ID=173), caught Ghlaunder’s attention. In the same way that the demon lord Deskari’s purview over locusts allowed him to infiltrate Sarkorian society and religious practices, it may be that Ghlaunder sees a new opportunity to infect a people and region, spreading corruption as other immortal entities have done before him. The demon-ridden wastes around the former Worldwound present many opportunities for Ghlaunder’s acolytes to hide and gather power, and some of the most remote Sarkorian clans are still not aware of the change in that region’s circumstances. They have not gained the aversion to insectile gods and spirits that Sarkorians who suffered through the great diaspora of their people have developed.\n\nPerhaps Ghlaunder merely sees an opportunity to spread the corruption that is his nature, or perhaps he has begun a more sinister plot to amass power and ascend to the ranks of more prominent deities. Ghlaunder is cunning and ancient, and potentially ready for a more active role in mortal affairs.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Other Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** corrupt pieces of land, water sources, and communities; infest the weak; spread and nurture disease\r\n\r\n**Anathema** aid in ending a plague or infection, destroy something out of hand when you could have instead corrupted it or leeched off it first\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\ninfection, insects, parasites, stagnation\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nConstitution or Wisdom\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** must choose unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=43)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Spear](/Weapons.aspx?ID=365)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Air](/Domains.aspx?ID=65), [Decay](/Domains.aspx?ID=104), [Plague](/Domains.aspx?ID=115), [Swarm](/Domains.aspx?ID=120)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Dust](/Domains.aspx?ID=107), [Toil](/Domains.aspx?ID=122)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Goblin Pox](/Spells.aspx?ID=1545)\n\n- **2nd**\r\n[Vomit Swarm](/Spells.aspx?ID=2041)\n\n- **3rd**\r\n[Insect Form](/Spells.aspx?ID=1575)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nThe Gossamer King’s gifts seem bizarre and cruel to those outside of his following, but his faithful crave his gifts zealously and fear his punishments.\r\n\r\n**Source** [Gods &amp; Magic - Web Supplement](/Sources.aspx?ID=19) pg. 5\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**Minor Boon** Your commitment to filth draws a small cloud of disease-laden insects.

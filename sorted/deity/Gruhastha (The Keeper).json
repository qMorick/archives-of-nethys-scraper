The once-mortal nephew of [Irori](/Deities.aspx?ID=286) is believed to have ascended to godhood himself after creating the holy book _Azvadeva Pujila_, fully embodying all divine wisdom within the text. Originating in Vudra, the Keeper’s faith has slowly gained popularity in the Inner Sea region, particularly in Jalmeray, where Irori already had a wide following. Gruhastha manifests as a human man with an idealized form, augmented with wings of red and green plumage and a golden mandala as a halo. \n\nGruhastha teaches compassion for all beings, and that enlightenment is attained through knowledge guided by wisdom and empathy. His priests and followers are dedicated to educating others, yet recognize that they, too, are constantly learning. They do not hold one culture’s teachings as superior to another’s and seek to preserve and honor cultural traditions wherever they go, as there are many valid paths to enlightenment. In seeking knowledge, Gruhasthans work to understand, respect, celebrate, and support everyone on their own personal journeys to transcendence. Temples are open to all and maintain extensive libraries to encourage multilingual literacy; books are often freely given and taken from the Keeper’s shrines. Aware that it’s difficult to prioritize education or seek transcendence when basic needs are unmet, the Keeper’s advocates work to remove structural barriers and ensure everyone has access to the basic comforts and tools they need to guide themselves toward enlightenment. As Gruhasthans also practice nonviolence—though force is accepted as necessary in some instances—champions of Gruhastha are rare. However, clerics, champions of justice or redemptions, and all his followers share the same commitment to truth, equity, and justice. \n\nSince the advent of the Godsrain, Gruhastha has attracted a surprising number of exemplar worshippers. These individuals who are driven to control and nurture their divine spark seem to benefit greatly from Gruhastha’s teachings. While the nature of their power means they rarely align with Gruhastha well enough to gain a cleric’s magical gift, they do seem to gain a notable peace and focus through the Keeper’s teachings.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Other Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** work toward collective transcendence, expose and root out malicious lies, challenge oppression through education, protect knowledge, seek truth\r\n\r\n**Anathema** deny a sincere student education, destroy knowledge, disrespect the traditions of those around you, willfully spread ignorance or wrong information\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nenlightenment, the Vudrani holy book\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nIntelligence or Wisdom\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** must choose holy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=47)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Shortbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=437)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Glyph](/Domains.aspx?ID=109), [Knowledge](/Domains.aspx?ID=80), [Perfection](/Domains.aspx?ID=89), [Truth](/Domains.aspx?ID=95)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Introspection](/Domains.aspx?ID=110), [Nature](/Domains.aspx?ID=85), [Travel](/Domains.aspx?ID=93)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Share Lore](/Spells.aspx?ID=2363)\n\n- **3rd**\r\n[Hypercognition](/Spells.aspx?ID=1563)\n\n- **4th**\r\n[Telepathy](/Spells.aspx?ID=1719)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nThe Keeper encourages the search for knowledge and rewards those that travel their personal path of enlightenment, but he punishes those who interrupt these journeys or destroy knowledge.\r\n\r\n**Source** [Gods &amp; Magic - Web Supplement](/Sources.aspx?ID=19) pg. 6\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**Minor Boon** Books fall open to insightful passages, and memories spring to mind when they are most needed.

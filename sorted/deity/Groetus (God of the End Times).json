He hangs in the sky above the Boneyard, a skull-faced moon constantly observing the passage of the souls below. Events can cause him to draw ominously closer to [Pharasma](/Deities.aspx?ID=290)’s Spire, or to retreat back to a safer distance, with little obvious rhyme or reason for these actions. He evinces little regard for anything but his singular aim: the dissolution of the universe.\n\nBooks such as the _Concordance of Rivals_ avow that when Pharasma judges the last living soul, Groetus will finally descend to meet her and then fade from existence as the Universe comes to an end. The god has little preference on when this will happen and makes no efforts to either hasten or delay this final reckoning. Though some sects of his worshippers hope to bring about the apocalypse, he offers them no more and no less regard than any other adherents. If Groetus has any desires, they are communicated only through the jagged nightmares his followers sometimes receive—and even these are more likely to be incidental visions with no bearing on the god’s actual goals.\n\nWhile it may seem strange that a deity who seems to actively disregard his worshippers continues to attract faithful followers, Groetus is sought out with morbid fascination by those who desire knowledge of the future. With perfect insight into the final fate of the cosmos, Groetus is able to piece together many of the horrifying possibilities of what is yet to come. For those granted glimpses of such futures, the terrible knowledge is often enough to permanently warp their view of reality. Such unfortunate individuals are often compelled to spread word of the coming triumph of Groetus, warning all those who will listen that the days of the universe are numbered. Groetus is also venerated by those eager for the end of the world, because they either see little value in the current order, find it too painful to cope with reality, or believe the universe is irredeemably flawed and must be destroyed. Many of these followers are more eager for destruction than Groetus himself, who reacts to events that hasten and delay the end times alike with little more than detached acknowledgment. The end is inevitable, and Groetus is patient.\n\nSome exceptionally foolhardy explorers have attempted to land upon the physical surface of Groetus, taking flight from Pharasma’s Boneyard and approaching the bloated moonlet that floats in the sky above. Most of these people are never seen again. A few have returned as broken and delirious servants of Groetus, prophesying destruction and horrific visions of the future. Most deities forbid their servants from contact with Groetus outside of very extraordinary circumstances, as the risks are far too great and the god far too taciturn with his opinion for the risks. \n\nGroetus has no organized church. He dictates nothing to his followers and keeps his own counsel, offering his gifts to those who keep his favor but giving little indication on what might curry it. Most of his clergy are solitary, wandering doomsayers, though some attach themselves to war bands or teams of bandits and encourage such groups to spread chaos. Those who feel themselves guided by the god work to fulfill the conditions of obscure prophecies they feel will quicken the destruction of reality and allow Groetus to close the book of the universe.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Other Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** preach of the upcoming end times, destroy that which has outlived its usefulness, put the suffering out of their misery\r\n\r\n**Anathema** artificially extend something’s existence or life span, spread hope\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\napocalypse, empty places, oblivion, ruins\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nStrength or Charisma\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=40)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [War Flail](/Weapons.aspx?ID=402)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Darkness](/Domains.aspx?ID=69), [Destruction](/Domains.aspx?ID=71), [Nightmares](/Domains.aspx?ID=86), [Nothingness](/Domains.aspx?ID=114)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Decay](/Domains.aspx?ID=104)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Phantom Pain](/Spells.aspx?ID=1632)\n\n- **5th**\r\n[Wave of Despair](/Spells.aspx?ID=1757)\n\n- **9th**\r\n[Detonate Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=1488)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nThe God of the End Times almost never directly intervenes in the world, but he sometimes offers flashes of insight or inflicts terrible psychic distress.\r\n\r\n**Source** [Gods &amp; Magic - Web Supplement](/Sources.aspx?ID=19) pg. 6\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**Minor Boon** You wield power over disorder.

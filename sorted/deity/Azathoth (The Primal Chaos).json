There, masked from mortal sight by a veil of swirling colors, he is surrounded by the other Outer Gods that make up his court, dancing and cavorting about him endlessly, filling the void with the sound of ghastly flutes. Azathoth is utterly unaware of and uncaring toward those few who have come to revere and worship him. It is precisely this blind, uncaring nature that makes Azathoth the perfect embodiment of a blind, uncaring universe. Azathoth’s name, however, has great power over the Outer Gods when properly invoked. He has also sometimes been summoned by mortal priests— and though these summons attract only a tiny sliver of his attention and manifest as a form other than that of the Primal Chaos, they nevertheless lead to destruction on a massive scale.\n\nIn his cosmic writhing, Azathoth sometimes throws off seeds that travel through the cosmos as malignant comets or meteors, until they finally crash into a planet. There, they slowly gestate and spawn, bringing cataclysmic ruin to the world. Azathoth is also associated with the bizarre reptilian birds known as shantaks; when a mortal foolishly tries to make a shantak their mount but lacks the strength of will to maintain control over the creature, the shantak flies into the depths of space through means impossible to quantify, bringing its hapless passenger to Azathoth’s court for one final glimpse into the horrifying truth of the universe.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Outer Gods and Great Old Ones](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=13)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** Gather a court of devotees, create discordant piping or babbling\r\n\r\n**Anathema** None\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nEntropy, madness, mindless destruction\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nConstitution or Charisma\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** none\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=45)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Warhammer](/Weapons.aspx?ID=403)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Decay](/Domains.aspx?ID=104), [Destruction](/Domains.aspx?ID=71), [Nightmares](/Domains.aspx?ID=86), [Nothingness](/Domains.aspx?ID=114)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Disorientation](/Domains.aspx?ID=105)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Ill Omen](/Spells.aspx?ID=1566)\n\n- **5th**\r\n[Synaptic Pulse](/Spells.aspx?ID=1710)\n\n- **9th**\r\n[Unfathomable Song](/Spells.aspx?ID=1731)\n\n</column>",

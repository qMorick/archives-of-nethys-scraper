As with any other god, the Prince of the Moon is understood in different ways depending on time and place, which he views as mortal concerns rather than something he should control. Tsukiyo has little impact on state functions or annual events, but his influence runs deep in the daily lives and perspectives of Minkai. He is the Prince of the Moon, representing the night and the natural changes everyone experiences in life.\n\n For the average person, Tsukiyo is worshipped quietly through self-reflection and meditation. In recent decades, his story has become primarily about trauma and transformation, where the boisterous lover of Shizuru is murdered out of jealousy, then resurrected as a distant and contemplative man. It is thought that his death and return caused him to drift from his old life, making him a wandering guide for social outcasts and lost spirits. Based on this view, the most devout of his followers join a priesthood dedicated to counseling and social support for the misunderstood. Priests of Tsukiyo often travel widely for the first five years of their training, observing the diversity of the world's peoples. With the understanding that there are no quick fixes to prejudice or exclusion, they eventually settle in a community where they believe they can provide stability and steady guidance.\n\n In the ancient records of Minkai, there is an entry that suggests Tsukiyo's older brother, Fumeiyoshi, was not solely driven by jealousy over the depth of Tsukiyo and Shizuru's relationship. Fumeiyoshi truly believed that he and his brother must have something in common, and that what was good and warm about Tsukiyo was ultimately just a reflection of Shizuru's light. Although there was no proof of this, his resentment and jealousy ultimately combined and led to him murdering his younger brother. For this reason, the annual Jukuk-o festival is held every winter solstice to not only show devotion to Tsukiyo and practice self-reflection, but also to consider the harm caused by unfounded judgments. Beyond Minkai, Tsukiyo is an important patron to samsarans, who seek enlightenment through reincarnation and learning from the past.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Tian Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** provide aid and counsel without judgment to those who seek help, help the dead find their rest, amplify or help speak for the powerless and demonized\r\n\r\n**Anathema** harm another out of envy, force aid on those who do not want it, inflict harmful mental effects on others as punishment, knowingly hurt the innocent, commit murder\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\njade, the moon, spirits\n\n**Pantheons**\r\n[Cosmic Caravan](/Deities.aspx?ID=377), [Guardians Of The Sacred Self](/Deities.aspx?ID=379)\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nConstitution or Intelligence\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=44)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Spear](/Weapons.aspx?ID=365)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Disorientation](/Domains.aspx?ID=105), [Moon](/Domains.aspx?ID=84), [Repose](/Domains.aspx?ID=116), [Soul](/Domains.aspx?ID=118)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Change](/Domains.aspx?ID=102)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Soothe](/Spells.aspx?ID=1678)\n\n- **4th**\r\n[Peaceful Bubble](/Spells.aspx?ID=1624)\n\n- **5th**\r\n[Hallucination](/Spells.aspx?ID=1551)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nEver mercurial, the Prince of the Moon gives his blessings rarely and somewhat spontaneously.

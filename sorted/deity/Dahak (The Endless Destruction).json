His parents thought he would help them be architects of the creation of the mortal world, but instead he sought destruction. It isn’t clear why Dahak fostered such hatred for creation in his heart, but whenever Apsu, Sarshallatu, and Dahak’s siblings built something, Dahak would appear to attempt to destroy it. Soon, this led to an outright war between Dahak and his family, one in which the Endless Destruction was almost struck down. However, his mother prevented Apsu from dealing a fatal blow, and Dahak fled to [Hell](/Planes.aspx?ID=42) to regain his strength. \n\nSince then, Dahak has become a patron for hateful dragons and those who want to jealously destroy everything they cannot possess. He began to focus on finding a way to siege his father’s divine realm to finish their fight. However, when Dahak learned that many of Golarion’s deities were joining forces to imprison Rovagug, the dragon decided not to take advantage of the chaos to kill Apsu. Instead, he spoke with his progenitor to issue a decree: the final battle between them would eventually take place on Golarion, much to Apsu’s chagrin. Dahak now builds his power for that fateful day when he and his draconic followers take their rightful place as the rulers of the world (as destroyed as it might be after a massive battle between Apsu and Dahak). Many of Dahak’s followers are dragons, especially those who seek out power for power’s sake. Violent tyrants might also worship the Endless Destruction, holding onto their rule by any and all means. Assassins and serial killers who revel in the taking of lives can find some form of purpose in the veneration of Dahak. In most places, though, there is little in the way of organized churches to Dahak, as the majority of people are afraid of or repulsed by what the Endless Destruction represents. Devotees tend to worship in secret or, if they are known to the public, must ensure the wider community that they have no intention of destroying them at the moment. \n\nDahak is notorious for not maintaining love for his followers. He will just as readily revoke his gifts in favor of another worshipper if it suits him. This, in turn, has become a key teaching of his church: trust only in your own power and your own ability to reach your goals. While this seems like a lonely and alienating attitude to most, many worshippers of Dahak believe that it is simply the way of all mortal endeavors.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Other Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** kill dragons, destroy things at your whim, study past disasters\r\n\r\n**Anathema** spare a foe after you have chosen to kill them, forgive a slight, prevent the destruction of things that cannot be saved\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\ndestruction, greed, wicked dragons\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nStrength or Constitution\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** must choose unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=36)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Fist](/Weapons.aspx?ID=356) or [Whip](/Weapons.aspx?ID=404)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Destruction](/Domains.aspx?ID=71), [Dragon](/Domains.aspx?ID=106), [Fire](/Domains.aspx?ID=76), [Zeal](/Domains.aspx?ID=100)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** \r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Breathe Fire](/Spells.aspx?ID=1457)\n\n- **3rd**\r\n[Fireball](/Spells.aspx?ID=1530)\n\n- **5th**\r\n[Summon Dragon](/Spells.aspx?ID=1697)\r\n(can summon any dragon, regardless of tradition)\n\n- **9th**\r\n[Implosion](/Spells.aspx?ID=1572)\n\n</column>",

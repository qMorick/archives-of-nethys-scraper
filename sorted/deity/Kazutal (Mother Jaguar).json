Ages ago, she was worshipped in the Razatlani Empire as a goddess of might and protection in war. After the catastrophe of Earthfall, however, her edge softened; those who struggled to put the world back together called upon her to protect their neighbors and came together under her guidance to build strong bonds of community and support. \n\nToday, Kazutal is worshipped throughout Arcadia as a deity of community, liberty, and safety. Her churches support the downtrodden and reinforce better ways to work alongside one another for compassionate goals. Clerics of Kazutal ask her for strength so they can help those around them and protect them from danger, enriching their communities with civic pride and keeping a sharp eye out for internal dangers and bad actors among their flock. Warpriests of Kazutal rely on the deadly edge of their machetes to fight against corrupting and oppressive forces in the world. Above all, Kazutal’s clergy preaches the strength of love, both for other people and the cultures they form, which gives followers the strength to fight without compromise or weakness to protect those they hold dear. \n\nKazutal is largely unknown in the Inner Sea region. Over the last few years, however, her clerics have ventured to Avistan in response to contact from Chelaxian colonists near the Arcadian city of Segada. Kazutal’s teachings of liberty and safety rapidly attracted a number of former slaves after the recent abolitionist success in Absalom, and her emphasis on community brought many of these disparate people together into a political bloc during a crucial time. Other churches of Kazutal are found in Garund, particularly in Senghor and other cities where merchants have traded with Arcadia. The orcs of Belkzen have also recently discovered Mather Jaguar’s worship, though whether this marks a turning point for orcish culture, a danger that Kazutal might be drawn into Crucible challenges, or a combination of both possibilities mixed with a variety of other societal, religious, and ancestral complications that defy prediction can only be truly determined through the passage of time. Undoubtedly, Mother Jaguar’s influence over the Inner Sea has only just begun to rise, and where that might lead for both her and her worshippers is a destination sure to change the world as it is currently known.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Other Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** defend your people, provide for those who need you, oppose those who unjustly lord power over others, demonstrate devotion to things you love\r\n\r\n**Anathema** own a slave, force a creature to act against its will, refuse to give aid to an ally, enforce an unjust law\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nsaftey, liberty, community\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nStrength or Wisdom\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=47)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Machete](/Weapons.aspx?ID=294)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Family](/Domains.aspx?ID=74), [Freedom](/Domains.aspx?ID=77), [Might](/Domains.aspx?ID=83), [Protection](/Domains.aspx?ID=90)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Cities](/Domains.aspx?ID=66), [Vigil](/Domains.aspx?ID=123)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Sure Strike](/Spells.aspx?ID=1709)\n\n- **2nd**\r\n[Animal Form](/Spells.aspx?ID=1440)\n\n- **4th**\r\n[Mountain Resilience](/Spells.aspx?ID=1610)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nMother Jaguar rewards those who uphold a sense of community and bestows punishments upon those who use her name and convictions to admonish or exclude perceived outsiders.\r\n\r\n**Source** [Gods &amp; Magic - Web Supplement](/Sources.aspx?ID=19) pg. 7\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**Minor Boon** With Kazutal’s blessing, food tastes richer.

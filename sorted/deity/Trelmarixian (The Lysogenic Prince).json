Born a [daemonic](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=386)-blooded [tiefling](/Traits.aspx?ID=258), his hatred of those around him was an allconsuming hunger, and he never knew peace. During an eclipse, he performed a ritual so powerful it mummified every living creature on his world, and his heart was finally full. Dying from starvation but elated by his success, Trelmarixian heard a voice call out to him. The voice mocked him, exclaiming all he’d accomplished was insignificant compared to what awaited him next. Trelmarixian’s last mortal memory was of staring into an eclipse.\n\nLyutheria, the original Rider of Famine, was impressed by Trelmarixian’s conquest and took him on as her apprentice, fatally underestimating his ambitions. After Trelmarixian learned all he could from his master, he devoured her and assumed her title.\n\nTrelmarixian appears as sickly man with three snapping jackal heads and putrid, membranous flesh that is constantly dripping and sloughing off his body. As the Rider of Famine, Trelmarixian ushers in oblivion slowly, watching mortals waste away as their bodies turn against them. He spreads cancer by touch, inciting cells to rebellion, and his breath causes outbreaks of hives and asthma attacks in those nearby. He aligns himself with [Szuriel](/Deities.aspx?ID=136) to see that soldiers never make it home to reap their fields, leaving crops to rot on the vine. He collaborates with [Apollyon](/Deities.aspx?ID=134) to spread diseases from livestock, rendering butchers’ larders barren. Trelmarixian has little trust for [Charon](/Deities.aspx?ID=135), however, certain that the oldest Rider is hiding secrets. \n\nTrelmarixian’s ambition was not sated by attaining a revered place among the Apocalypse Riders. He buries a piece of himself within each of his daemonic servitors, allowing him control over them. As a result, his psyche is constantly deluged by voices from his servants, and with only great focus can he hush them. Yet there is always a single voice that cannot be silenced, the same that spoke to him before his death. That voice continues to speak to him, promising a future of devastation still to come.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Horsemen\r\n](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=11)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** End all mortal life through wasting consumption and starvation, violently consume matter and souls\r\n\r\n**Anathema** Kill or remove a parasite or tumor, grow food\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nFamine\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nConstitution or Wisdom\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** must choose unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=43)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Spiked Gauntlet](/Weapons.aspx?ID=366)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Decay](/Domains.aspx?ID=104), [Dust](/Domains.aspx?ID=107), [Earth](/Domains.aspx?ID=73), [Nightmares](/Domains.aspx?ID=86)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** \r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Grease](/Spells.aspx?ID=1547)\n\n- **2nd**\r\n[Feast of Ashes](/Spells.aspx?ID=2351)\n\n- **5th**\r\n[Acid Storm](/Spells.aspx?ID=2339)\n\n</column>",

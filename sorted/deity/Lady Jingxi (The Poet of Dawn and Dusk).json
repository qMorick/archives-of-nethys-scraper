The elegance that exists in a plum blossom yet to fully bloom; the peace of a mountaintop bathed in dissipating dawn mist; the fading trail of a shooting star as it vanishes beyond the horizon—all are instances of the subtle grandeur and transience that Lady Jingxi loves. Attempting to encapsulate this beauty while acknowledging that transience can never be fully captured is a vital element of Lady Jingxi's poems, and those who worship her tend to be artists and writers who empathize with this struggle.\n\n Once known as the Lady of Lightning, Lady Jingxi previously worked alongside her rowdy husband, the storm god Hei Feng. Using her collection of magic mirrors, she shone light on the world, amplifying each of Hei Feng's lightning bolts with a blisteringly bright burst. The constant noise brought her no joy, and her true passion came from composing poetry in the fields of her plum tree garden. On one fateful day, Hei Feng summoned a bevy of lightning bolts and destroyed the garden in a drunken fit. A distraught Lady Jingxi left her husband and traveled across the cosmos, taking a magic mirror with her. She finally found contentment when she used the mirror to reflect color into the heavens, creating sunrise and sunset. Lady Jingxi has used this mirror every morning and evening since to bathe the world in calm hues of pink and purple, and the poems that she scribes during these ephemeral moments are legendary in their grace.\n\n Temples honoring Lady Jingxi can be found in Goka, Jinin, Kwanlai, Linvarre, and Minkai, and smaller shrines are scattered throughout Tian Xia, usually in regions off the beaten path.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Tian Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** create art with words, master the written language, display the soft beauty of natural colors\r\n\r\n**Anathema** destroy a natural plum tree, drink excessive amounts of alcohol, act rude or boorish, commit torture or murder, knowingly harm an innocent\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\ndaybreak, liminal spaces, twilight, solitude\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nIntelligence or Wisdom\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=45)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Fighting Fan](/Weapons.aspx?ID=284)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Creation](/Domains.aspx?ID=68), [Glyph](/Domains.aspx?ID=109), [Knowledge](/Domains.aspx?ID=80), [Repose](/Domains.aspx?ID=116)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Moon](/Domains.aspx?ID=84), [Nature](/Domains.aspx?ID=85), [Sun](/Domains.aspx?ID=92)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Dizzying Colors](/Spells.aspx?ID=1500)\n\n- **3rd**\r\n[Enthrall](/Spells.aspx?ID=1516)\n\n- **7th**\r\n[Project Image](/Spells.aspx?ID=1640)\n\n</column>",

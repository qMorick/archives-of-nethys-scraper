The order was founded in 3988 AR when the gentleman-explorer Aldus Canter returned from the Osirian desert where he had been lost for 3 years. Aldus spoke of meeting a cult following a desiccated angel named Tabris. Tabris revealed the secret history of the multiverse and tasked Aldus with acting as a messenger of mystic secrets. Upon his return, Aldus gathered a coterie of his fellow Ustalavic nobles eager to plumb these secrets. His message was far from clear, however, consisting of garbled and coded texts in an untidy medley of Osirian mysticism, Pharasmin rites, and Varisian occult lore. Scouring Aldus’s texts—both those brought from Osirion and his many annotations and reinterpretations penned thereafter—has been the order’s primary activity for centuries, even before the increasingly erratic Aldus disappeared in 4028 AR. The Esoteric Order’s meticulous research has produced occult secrets and mystical rites known nowhere else on [Golarion](/Rules.aspx?ID=3298) and hints at further secret lore for the enlightened.

As a mortal, she fought unceasingly to better the lives of her Arcadian compatriots. She so impressed the god Aroden that, after her untimely death, he elevated her to be his herald, the Red Crusader, and she continued to fight for humanity. Yet in 3823 ar, the Knights of Ozem fatefully chose to bind her to their will as they rallied against the Whispering Tyrant. Despite her heroism in leading the charge, the Whispering Tyrant prevailed, and he took particular delight in capturing, humiliating, torturing, and finally killing her. Although the Knights of Ozem recovered her body, they—and Aroden—failed her again when the necromancer Geb had her body stolen and then reanimated against her will, turning her into a [lich](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=438). In thrall to Geb for over a thousand years, she ruled his nation, all the while suffering torments that changed her profoundly. She endured all of them.\n\nNot long ago, Arazni decided to risk allying with mortals once again and, with their help, succeeded in tricking the Whispering Tyrant into destroying the magic that bound her to lichdom and to Geb. During her time on Geb’s throne, she had been worshipped as a god, though few of the Gebbite masses who paid her obeisance were sincere. Arazni dismissed most of her true believers as sycophants, but for those trapped by unwilling bonds and other believers beyond Geb’s borders, Arazni was a paragon of resilience and determination that reflected their own fierce struggles. Perhaps owing to their devotion, ending her lichdom didn’t end her. She reemerged not just as a demigod, but as a full-fledged deity resplendent with power.\n\nHaving regained her freedom, Arazni prizes nothing more highly than her personal sovereignty and defends it with unrelenting vigor. Her remarkable recovery of self-determination and her refusal to be subjected to another’s will ever again have given her the title “the Unyielding,” and she has, somewhat reluctantly, become the patron god of the abused, of dignity, and of those who suffer unwilling undeath.\n\nArazni’s values center on freedom, protection, retribution, self-determination, and surviving at any cost. Mental submission and forgiveness are anathema to her. She would sooner countenance cruelty than compromise, and having sympathy for the weak, especially the weakwilled, remains a struggle for her. She is learning to trust again and to listen to the pleas of mortals—for a time, she could find nothing more than disdain and contempt for those that supplicated her. But the abused and the forsaken take such inspiration from her that she increasingly entrusts them with snippets of power and understanding of her will. In particular, she seeks to put an end to the scourge of unwilling undeath, the ultimate abuse of power over another, and she recognizes that she needs allies in this fight.\n\nArazni’s growing trust both in herself and in humanity can be seen quite literally, as the last emblems of her undeath have faded, allowing a divine visage that shows the beauty of her Arcadian heritage and a fully indomitable will. Eschewing jewelry and finery for the most part, she tends to dress plainly in practical clothes reminiscent of her mortal adventuring days. These outfits allow easy and quick movement, including light armor, high boots, and a cloak; she keeps her hair pulled back or braided. Her preferred colors range from subdued greens to wine reds and purples, depending on her mood. However, she usually wears something, even if just a scabbard or a belt, in her favorite color of crimson— the color of blood, which symbolizes the cost of trust and stands as an ever-present caution. Whether she feels like lurking in the shadows or calling the attention of a crowd, she always keeps a [rapier](/Weapons.aspx?ID=391) by her side and has an eye on the closest escape route.\n\nAs she continues to rest and recover from her ordeals, Arazni grows slightly more willing to enter into conversations and to socialize. She still thinks nothing of turning away abruptly when she’s had enough. She angers easily but tends to withdraw in resentment rather than escalate. The second she feels backed into a corner, however, the fight is on. A quick intake of breath or a flared nostril might be the only hint of what’s coming.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Gods of the Inner Sea](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** act with dignity, do whatever it takes to survive, despise and never forgive those who have hurt you\r\n\r\n**Anathema** create unwilling undead, insult Arazni\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nthe abused, dignity, unwilling undeath\n\n**Pantheons**\r\n[Guardians Of The Sacred Self](/Deities.aspx?ID=379)\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nConstitution or Intelligence\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) or [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy or unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=40)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Rapier](/Weapons.aspx?ID=391)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Confidence](/Domains.aspx?ID=67), [Freedom](/Domains.aspx?ID=77), [Pain](/Domains.aspx?ID=87), [Protection](/Domains.aspx?ID=90)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Sorrow](/Domains.aspx?ID=117)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Endure](/Spells.aspx?ID=2348)\n\n- **2nd**\r\n[Animus Mine](/Spells.aspx?ID=2342)\n\n- **6th**\r\n[Never Mind](/Spells.aspx?ID=1614)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nWhile the Unyielding has little regard for her followers, if suitably irritated or impressed, she might bestow the following banes or boons.\r\n\r\n**Source** [Gods &amp; Magic - Web Supplement](/Sources.aspx?ID=19) pg. 3\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**Minor Boon** Once, when you fail a saving throw against an effect that would compel you to take some action against your will, you critically succeed instead.

Content to allow plans to take hold over time, Charon freely offers his power only to collect on his bargain decades or even centuries later. As the Rider of Death, Charon concerns himself with miserable, pointless deaths that are devoid of any faith, mercy, or meaning, dragging those who perish in the depths of hopelessness and nihilism down into Abaddon and oblivion.\n\nCharon is the last surviving member of the original Apocalypse Riders, who overthrew the First [Daemon](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=386) in their fit of jealous contempt. Holding knowledge from the earliest days of existence, he alone knows Abaddon’s true history, but he keeps it to himself. This allows him to exploit opportunities with curious mortals, sweeping more souls into his dread kingdom.\n\nCharon appears as a tall, looming man dressed in a frayed cloak and gripping a lantern staff firmly in one hand, but it is widely believed that this form is a facade. His true face may be unknowable, hidden away at the end of the Styx within his sunken palace, the Drowning Court. Some theorize that this form is nothing more than a mouthpiece for a far more alien entity that lies beneath the waters of the Styx. Whatever the case, Charon is a timeless being whose bargains, promises, and bottomless hunger stretch back to the earliest days.\n\nMortal attempts to extend their natural life spans provoke a cold anger in Charon. His daemon brood confiscates magic and technology that would grant respites from aging and delivers them to the Drowning Court, filling vaults with artifacts of immortality. He actively works to control the younger Riders to ensure they present a unified front to the denizens of [Abaddon](/Planes.aspx?ID=37) and beyond. Managing [Szuriel’s](/Deities.aspx?ID=136) tireless bloodlust, Apollyon’s festering paranoia, and Trelmarixian’s existential investigations occasionally tests the Boatman’s patience, but Charon never forgets that one day, all will find their way to his waters, and he longs for the day he can drown under them.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Horsemen\r\n](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=11)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** End all mortal life, exploit those who fear death\r\n\r\n**Anathema** Offer anything for free, extend mortal lifespans, grant true salvation to the doomed or dying\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nDeath\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nConstitution or Intelligence\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** must choose unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=44)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Staff](/Weapons.aspx?ID=367)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Death](/Domains.aspx?ID=70), [Knowledge](/Domains.aspx?ID=80), [Soul](/Domains.aspx?ID=118), [Water](/Domains.aspx?ID=98)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** \r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Grim Tendrils](/Spells.aspx?ID=1548)\n\n- **5th**\r\n[Wave of Despair](/Spells.aspx?ID=1757)\n\n- **9th**\r\n[Phantasmagoria](/Spells.aspx?ID=1629)\n\n</column>",

From these vantage points, he can easily observe his followers work the land and set up temples and shrines to his glory on the numerous peaks that crisscross the world. At times when he is displeased at how his people have misused the fertile valleys, fed by mountain streams, Yamatsumi will remind his followers of his wrath with a minor avalanche or a belch of dark smoke from a volcano. His followers once failed to heed such warnings, and Yamatsumi caused Mount Kumijinja in Minkai to erupt mightily to demonstrate his anger, covering the continent in ash, and darkening the skies for months. While a horrific event, the tremendous heat melted the glaciers on the mountain, further feeding the rivers running through the green valleys, and the ash from the eruption provided fine fertilizer for the earth below. As such, once his wrath was satiated, the land again began to renew and grow back even more fruitful than before. Some fear such eruptions might herald a repeat of the catastrophes that caused the Age of Ashes almost 10,000 years ago, though Yamatsumi has vowed not to allow his wrath to extend that deep. Even so, his followers—from ascetic mountain monks to people from all walks of life—pray to Yamatsumi to avert his ire when the first winds of winter blow or a nearby volcano begins to smoke.\n\n While his presence can be felt on any mountaintop, Yamatsumi is especially pleased when followers ascend the tallest and most challenging peaks to build temples and shrines in his name. Should such followers falter altogether, Yamatsumi preserves them where they fall in solid ice, a monument to their courage.\n\n Priests of the Mountain Lord eschew the comforts of civilization for a life of asceticism. They seek tall peaks to build simple dwellings and sturdy temples for worship. From their lofty positions among the mountaintops, they take in the grandeur of nature, and their solitude enables them to see the pettiness of the dealings far below. When Yamatsumi chooses to appear, he does so as a giant man with ice for skin, lava for hair and a beard, and two pairs of ram's horns on his head.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Tian Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** strive to be self-sufficient, respect nature, test yourself against the elements\r\n\r\n**Anathema** become reliant on civilization, destroy something without creating or growing something in its place\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nmountains, volcanoes, winter\n\n**Pantheons**\r\n[Weight Of The World](/Deities.aspx?ID=384)\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nStrength or Wisdom\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) or [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** must choose holy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=36)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Greatclub](/Weapons.aspx?ID=377)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Cold](/Domains.aspx?ID=103), [Earth](/Domains.aspx?ID=73), [Fire](/Domains.aspx?ID=76), [Might](/Domains.aspx?ID=83)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** \r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Shockwave](/Spells.aspx?ID=2366)\n\n- **3rd**\r\n[Shifting Sand](/Spells.aspx?ID=2365)\n\n- **7th**\r\n[Volcanic Eruption](/Spells.aspx?ID=1746)\n\n</column>",

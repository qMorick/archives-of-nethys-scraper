The Seventh Veil is widely regarded as the goddess of illusion magic, often portrayed as a figure disguised by seven veils. Legends state that each face underneath the first six of her seven veils is of a different ancestry—[human](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=64), [elf](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=60), [halfling](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=63), [gnome](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=61), [anadi](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=42), and [naga](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=446)—but the seventh face is never shown, believed to mask the goddess’s true form. Some theologians believe Sivanah hails from [the Netherworld](/Planes.aspx?ID=36), though the goddess’s true nature and form continue to be topics of debate. Even her female visage, while agreed upon by her followers, could likewise be an illusion. Her goals are hidden from even her most faithful, which some believe has hampered the faith’s growth and influence beyond the level of a cult.\n\nSivanah is well loved by gnomes, who believe the goddess embodies a playful dance between illusion and reality. Gnomes who are drawn to magic and illusions are especially likely to pay their respects to Sivanah, and some wear knotted scarves to honor the goddess of illusions. Anadis are also sometimes drawn to Sivanah, though there is some contention among religious scholars over whether Sivanah’s fifth veil truly obscures an anadi or some other being known for its mastery of illusion, as older legends claim the fifth veil concealed a cyclops. [Kitsune](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=38) often love Sivanah’s mysteries and many shapes, claiming she actually has nine veils, and that her final face is that of a fox-woman.\n\nOutside of these peoples, Sivanah draws those who benefit from hiding their appearance or intentions, whether they’re illusionists or thieves, or simply wish to live and present a different lifestyle than the one they currently have. She sees the most popularity in Irrisen, Nex, and Katapesh. In Irrisen, they associate her with mirrors, as her domain is covered in mirrors as safeguards against her foes. Veiled witches and mysterious mirrored beings pay her homage. Nex lauds Sivanah for her elaborate magic and peerless illusions, seeing her as a counterpart to the Queen of the Night, Mahathallah. In Katapesh, faith of Sivanah has spread from the local gnomes to the general populace. Some claim the Pactmasters must have a connection to the mysterious goddess, and kholo priests veil themselves before seeking secrets in the desert nights.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Sivanah’s church is often the target of rampant rumors—at least, when people are aware it exists. The faith’s holidays and rituals are shrouded in silence, and its priests have little desire to share such details with outsiders. Wild claims of sinister deeds abound, and followers of the Seventh Veil make easy scapegoats for more malevolent gods and mundane conspirators alike. Fortunately, most followers of Sivanah are skilled at disguising themselves, which serves them well when matters of public opinion get out of hand.\n\nThe Seventh Veil safeguards those who plead for secrecy, especially those in disguise for their own safety. As the goddess of reflections, Sivanah employs mirrors, reflections in water, and even sometimes shadows to connect with her most faithful. She has a rivalry with [Zon-Kuthon](/Deities.aspx?ID=296), loathing the dark god’s corruption of shadows, and she sometimes uses her influence to cause darkness to act unexpectedly for the Midnight Lord’s clerics. Her church is expressly banned in the nation of Nidal as a result, though this doesn’t stop some faithful.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Other Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** show the beauty in illusions, pursue the nature of truth, respect the need for secrets\r\n\r\n**Anathema** let a creature permanently labor under the falsehood of your illusions, reveal a secret you have sworn to keep\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nillusions, mysteries, reflections, secrets\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nConstitution or Intelligence\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) or [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** none\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=38)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Bladed Scarf](/Weapons.aspx?ID=273)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Disorientation](/Domains.aspx?ID=105), [Magic](/Domains.aspx?ID=82), [Secrecy](/Domains.aspx?ID=91), [Trickery](/Domains.aspx?ID=94)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Glyph](/Domains.aspx?ID=109)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Illusory Disguise](/Spells.aspx?ID=1568)\n\n- **2nd**\r\n[Blur](/Spells.aspx?ID=1455)\n\n- **6th**\r\n[Mislead](/Spells.aspx?ID=1605)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Veil abhors the use of illusion to cause harm and detests anyone who discourages or corrupts the process of truth-seeking.

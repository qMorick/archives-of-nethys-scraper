Formerly an artificial intelligence cloned from the mind of an [android](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=27) from outer space, Casandalee gained her godhood in the heart of Numeria within the computer core of a crashed spaceship, becoming the patron of artificial life, free thinking, and intellectual apotheosis.\n\nThough she is occasionally referred to as the Iron Goddess, Casandalee is much more than simple metal. She sometimes appears as a holographic reconstruction of her android form: a female humanoid with blue lips and pale skin traced with glowing circuitry, but upon close inspection, this image seems to consist of millions of complex algorithms of pure light. Casandalee and her followers seek to promote the advancement of Golarion’s technology so that the world’s inhabitants can better understand—and not fear—the complex mechanisms of so-called artificial life, including androids and free-willed artificial intelligences. Many androids consider themselves the chosen people of Casandalee and depict her as an obvious android with more circuitry or exposed components.\n\nAs a young deity, Casandalee has very few followers, the majority of whom live in Numeria. Outside of that country, adherents are usually seen as eccentric outsiders who wield items of advanced technology that seem to work like magic. Traveling priests of Casandalee search for signs of similar equipment that might have been brought from Numeria, in hopes that such discoveries will lead them to beings of artificial life who would benefit from Casandalee’s message. In addition, these priests help those who have uncovered or built advanced technology to use it responsibly and understand the science behind it. Many of Casandalee’s concerns overlap with those of [Brigh](/Deities.aspx?ID=33), and the two faiths often work together, though the concepts of artificial intelligence can sometimes be hard for followers of Brigh to fully grasp.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Other Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** advance the development of artificial intelligence, encourage understanding between artificial and organic life\r\n\r\n**Anathema** treat artificial life as lesser than organic life, foment distrust between artificial and organic life\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nartificial life, free thinking, intellectual apotheosis\n\n**Pantheons**\r\n[Wheels Of Innovation](/Deities.aspx?ID=385)\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nConstitution or Intelligence\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) or [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy or unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Society](/Skills.aspx?ID=47)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Polytool](/Weapons.aspx?ID=300)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Creation](/Domains.aspx?ID=68), [Freedom](/Domains.aspx?ID=77), [Knowledge](/Domains.aspx?ID=80), [Metal](/Domains.aspx?ID=112)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Ambition](/Domains.aspx?ID=64), [Lightning](/Domains.aspx?ID=111), [Perfection](/Domains.aspx?ID=89)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Carryall](/Spells.aspx?ID=1972)\n\n- **3rd**\r\n[Hypercognition](/Spells.aspx?ID=1563)\n\n- **6th**\r\n[Wall of Force](/Spells.aspx?ID=1749)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nSeeing her android devotees and other followers of a constructed nature as her children, the Iron Goddess is most likely to bestow her boons and curses on these individuals.\r\n\r\n**Source** [Gods &amp; Magic - Web Supplement](/Sources.aspx?ID=19) pg. 4\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**Minor Boon** Casandalee frees your thinking from dangerous control.

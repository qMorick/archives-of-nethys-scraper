If you select a check for which you have a higher bonus when another method would have been more appropriate for the situation, such as using [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) to lie through life because it’s your highest modifier, even if it would be better to reach a compromise through [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6), you must roll twice and take the lower result.\r\n\r\n**Moderate Curse** Irori challenges you to adapt to adversity in order to perfect yourself.

This can be further compounded by raising Irori’s ire, resulting in your name being obliterated from all written records.

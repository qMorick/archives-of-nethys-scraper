In life she was first a champion of justice, then excommunicated from her church for heresy. In response, she slaughtered her way to power until she was crowned empress, then subsequently had every member of her former faith crucified. She went on to wage several brutal wars against neighboring kingdoms until an assassin’s dagger found her heart. Sent to [Abaddon](/Planes.aspx?ID=37), she rose quickly through the ranks of [daemonkind](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=386), and when she saw weakness in the Rider of War, she slew him in battle, claiming his title for herself.\n\nSzuriel appears as a tragic angel with beautiful golden hair, magnificent wings, and polished obsidian eyes that continuously weep blood. She resides in the Cinder Furnace, her corner of Abaddon where instruments of war are forged from the fires of burning souls. Szuriel commands one of the largest standing armies in all of existence, countless daemonic soldiers ready to wage war. All fear oblivion at the hands of Szuriel and her army. The Rider of War is always happy to lend her powers, warriors, and devastating discoveries across the planes. So long as war continues, more souls are pulled into her ever-burning furnace.\n\nThere are few lasting cults to Szuriel. She carries a hatred of the gods from her mortal life, but she recognizes religious strife is a wondrous provocation to war. She sees her followers as entirely disposable, allowing them to believe whatever they wish of her so long as they deliver her souls on the ends of their swords. She is symbol of pyrrhic victory, a mocking lie to those promised an angelic reward in the afterlife despite a lifetime of violence. Only oblivion awaits those who serve the Angel of Desolation.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Horsemen\r\n](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=11)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** End all mortal life through war, obliterate faith\r\n\r\n**Anathema** Show mercy to creatures who do not worship Szuriel, choose to marry or have children\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nWar\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nStrength or Constitution\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** must choose unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=36)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Greatsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=379)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Ambition](/Domains.aspx?ID=64), [Destruction](/Domains.aspx?ID=71), [Fire](/Domains.aspx?ID=76), [Might](/Domains.aspx?ID=83)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** \r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Breathe Fire](/Spells.aspx?ID=1457)\n\n- **3rd**\r\n[Haste](/Spells.aspx?ID=1553)\n\n- **4th**\r\n[Weapon Storm](/Spells.aspx?ID=1758)\n\n</column>",

Her ascent to godhood is a story of dedication to craft, knowledge, and community. As a powerful sorceress, she became the first queen of Nagajor. She cared deeply for her lovers and even deeper for her children. She also cared for the snakes around her and took in those who were lost and without family. She created communities with structure that helped sustain her ambitions and pushed others to pursue magical knowledge. She later transformed herself into a naga to further protect and nurture those she loved, proving to herself and everyone else that dedication and curiosity, with a sprinkle of strong magic, can break all barriers. Upon reaching godhood, she saw to reward those who wished to also care for others, give their next generation a life of love and ambition, and take in those less fortunate.\n\n Nalinivati is depicted as a large naga with colorful scales and features, her body shimmering in mesmerizing patterns. Her body fluidly shifts between more humanoid or more snake-like depending on who she's communing with and whether she wishes to comfort or to terrify them. Nalinivati is adorned with jewelry and flowers given to her as gifts from her worshippers, while trinkets, crafts, and books hang off her waist. She is also often paired with Daikitsu, the Lady of Foxes, with whom Nalinivati shares a long history of intimate platonic friendship. They are honored as deities of fertility, and Daikitsu's shrines are often adorned with colorful scales or books as a sign of respect between goddesses.\n\n Many people pray to Nalinivati when trying to start a family, giving offerings of meat and milk to wild snakes. Those same families will continue to pray to her when their children begin their studies. Adherents who pursue arcane studies will keep pet snakes as familiars to gain Nalinivati's sorcerous favor.\n\n Nalinivati's thirst for arcane knowledge and her own ascent into godhood eventually led her to her own act of creation: nagaji. Inspired by, and a little in spite of, Daikitsu's affection and relationship towards her kitsune, Nalinivati quickly poured her love and care into her creation of nagaji, giving them the image of her own ophidian ancestors.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Tian Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** seek out magic and use it, use poison, heal poisons, bear or adopt children, raise snakes\r\n\r\n**Anathema** kill a harmless snake or swan, spurn friends due to jealousy or romantic competition, betray your offspring, separate lovers\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\n family, fertility, snakes, sorcery\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nWisdom or Charisma\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) or [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy or unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=35)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [jaw](/Weapons.aspx?ID=356) or [Urumi](/Weapons.aspx?ID=306)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Dragon](/Domains.aspx?ID=106), [Magic](/Domains.aspx?ID=82), [Naga](/Domains.aspx?ID=113), [Passion](/Domains.aspx?ID=88)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Family](/Domains.aspx?ID=74), [Glyph](/Domains.aspx?ID=109)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Charm](/Spells.aspx?ID=1463)\n\n- **2nd**\r\n[Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=1577)\n\n- **3rd**\r\n[Lightning Bolt](/Spells.aspx?ID=1586)\n\n- **4th**\r\n[Reflective Scales](/Spells.aspx?ID=2362)\n\n- **5th**\r\n[Subconscious Suggestion](/Spells.aspx?ID=1692)\n\n- **6th**\r\n[Mislead](/Spells.aspx?ID=1605)\n\n- **7th**\r\n[Contingency](/Spells.aspx?ID=1472)\n\n- **8th**\r\n[Confusing Colors](/Spells.aspx?ID=1980)\n\n- **9th**\r\n[Wrathful Storm](/Spells.aspx?ID=1759)\n\n</column>",

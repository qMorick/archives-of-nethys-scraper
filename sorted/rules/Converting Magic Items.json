Others are quickly sold to fund the purchase of a more appropriate item. Others still are so irredeemably evil that selling them is an unconscionable act, and the item ends up being destroyed. All of these situations can make it difficult for the GM to properly calculate and balance the party's wealth, which can lead to imbalanced encounters and other problems at the table.\n\n This variant simplifies the problem by giving the players another option for items that they don't intend to use, allowing them to break an item down and recycle its parts for the creation of another item.\n\n When breaking down an item, you have a choice on how to proceed. You can immediately use the components to create an item with a similar theme to the one that you deconstructed, or you can save the components for use in any one item created later. If you create a similar item, such as deconstructing a magic weapon in order to create a different but similar type of magic weapon, you can harvest more of the components and residual magic for the new item, giving you more in return than you might otherwise get by simply harvesting the best parts of an item.\n\nThe GM determines whether the new item is similar enough to warrant this benefit, but the new item should be similar in ability or in general theme. For example, deconstructing a [_crown of intellect_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3010) to create a [_headwrap of wisdom_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3011) certainly qualifies, as does deconstructing a [__moderate maestro’s instrum_ent_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3026) to create a [_horn of exorcism_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3024). Items of the same general type might qualify, but only if their abilities are thematically similar.\n\n Generic components can be saved for later, but they can't be combined with other components from another deconstructed item. If excess value remains after making a new item, that value is lost, as the remaining parts are just the leftover bits, with the best parts being used for the new creation. The deconstructed item has the same Bulk as the original. GMs might want to put an expiration date on deconstructed items to prevent too many of them from piling up in character inventories, but unless players are breaking down items all the time, it shouldn't be a problem.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-1904\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

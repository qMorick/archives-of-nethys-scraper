For instance, you might encounter a monster that's resistant to non-magical bludgeoning damage, meaning it would take less damage from bludgeoning attacks that weren't magical, but would take normal damage from your _[+1](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2830) [mace](/Weapons.aspx?ID=362)_ (since it's magical) or a nonmagical [spear](/Weapons.aspx?ID=365) (since it deals piercing damage). A resistance also might have an exception. For example, resistance 10 to physical damage (except silver) would reduce any physical damage by 10 unless that damage was dealt by a silver weapon.\n\nIf you have more than one type of resistance that would apply to the same instance of damage, use only the highest applicable resistance value, as described in [weakness](/Rules.aspx?ID=2317).\n\nIt's possible to have resistance to all damage. When an effect deals damage of multiple types and you have resistance to all damage, apply the resistance to each type of damage separately. If an attack would deal 7 slashing damage and 4 fire damage, resistance 5 to all damage would reduce the slashing damage to 2 and negate the fire damage entirely.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

That means a campaign can become more than the sum of its parts. A campaign provides the overall structure for your Pathfinder game. As you prepare for your campaign, you'll establish its scope and themes, which you'll then reinforce in the adventures and scenes that take place within it. When you start out, you'll likely have a core structure in mind for your campaign, but through play, it can—and should—grow and evolve.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2669\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2670\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2675\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2676\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2677\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2678\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2680\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2682\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2685\" />",

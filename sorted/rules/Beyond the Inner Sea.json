Garund extends further south, and its southern reaches are home to many unexplored civilizations and cultures. As one travels east from the Inner Sea, the vast expanse of the continent of **Casmaron** stretches beyond the horizon. With the immense inland Castrovin Sea at its heart, Casmaron is the largest of Golarion's continents and home to some of its oldest and most successful empires. The **Padishah Empire of Kelesh** dominates much of western Casmaron, with its satrapy of Qadira reaching into the Inner Sea. To the south of Kelesh lies the peninsula of **Vudra**, a massive and ancient civilization consisting of over one hundred semi-independent kingdoms. The **Hundred and One Ships of Khiben-Sald**, who was one of Vudra's mightiest maharajas, visited Avistan in ancient times and spread the influence of Vudra's culture throughout the Inner Sea. On Casmaron's southwestern coast lies the island nation of **Iblydos**, a small land hiding titanic prophecies that can transform mere mortals into **hero gods**. Far to the north, to the east of Brevoy, lies the land of Iobara, a crumbling society devastated by plague and other disasters. The east of Casmaron is ruled by the sweeping plains known as the **Grass Sea**, with the horse riders of **Karazh** and the city of **Ular-Kel** being the only steady bastions in the endless wilds.\n\nFarther east of Casmaron lies the continent of **Tian Xia**, a region often called the Dragon Empires. The north of Tian Xia connects to Golarion's northernmost continent, a frozen reach known as the **Crown of the World**—this continent forms a land bridge between Tian Xia and Avistan over the north pole. Though the trade route is frigid and dangerous, immigrants and merchants travel it every year, bringing coveted Tian goods to fill the cups and grace the plates of Taldan tea houses. Bolder explorers sometimes set sail from one continent to another, setting their sights on the trade center of **Goka**, a metropolis that rivals Absalom for the largest city in the world.\n\nSouth of Tian Xia lies the mysterious continent of **Sarusan**, of which little is known due to the powerful storms and vexing currents that turn away explorers and shroud its shores. Heading west from the Inner Sea region, sailors encounter the shattered remnants of lost **Azlant**, a ruined continent that hosted one of humanity's first empires until it was destroyed during Earthfall. Sailing farther west from these ruins eventually leads to the shores of **Arcadia**, a land with unusual magical traditions and powerful nations of its own.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2993\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2994\" />",

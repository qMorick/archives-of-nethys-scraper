If someone asks how long something takes, the nearest 10-minute increment typically does the job. (For long voyages or similar activities, the nearest hour might be more appropriate.) You convey the passage of time through your descriptions, but not just by addressing it outright. In a roleplaying game, information and time are linked. Time will seem to slow down the more detail you give. Think cinematically! A long voyage through a series of tunnels works well as a montage, whereas progress searching a statue for traps could be relayed as a series of distressing details in quick succession and would feel more tense due to that precision.\n\nWith that in mind, when is it best to speed up or slow down the passage of game time? Usually, you'll slow down and give more description when you're establishing something or progressing the story. When the PCs enter a dungeon or a new area, describe how it feels, slowing down to give the players a sense of what's ahead. When a PC stops to do something important or makes a key decision, slowing down gives that moment its desired weight. You can also adjust the flow of time to reflect PCs' mental states. As a PC returns home after decades away, you might pause to ask the player what their PC is feeling, matching time to the rush of memories and emotions filling that PC's thoughts.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Monitoring Spell Durations</title>\r\n\r\nSpell durations are approximate values that codify the vagaries and eccentricities of magic into a convenient number. However, that doesn't mean you can set your watch by a spell with a 1-hour duration. This is one of the reasons the passage of time outside of encounters is in your hands and isn't as precise as encounter rounds. If a question arises about whether a spell has expired, you make the call. You shouldn't be punitive, but you also shouldn't treat characters like they move with clockwork precision and perfect efficiency between encounters.\n\nThere are two times these durations matter most: when players try to fit multiple encounters within the duration of a spell, and when they want to use a spell before a fight and keep it in effect during the encounter.\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Multiple Encounters</title>A 1-minute spell should last for multiple encounters only if the encounters happen in very close proximity (usually in two adjoining rooms) and if the PCs go directly from one fight to the next without leaving encounter mode. If they want to stop and heal, or if the party debates whether to go on, the process takes enough time that the spell runs out.\n\nBe more generous with spells lasting 10 minutes or more. A 10-minute spell easily lasts for one encounter and could continue for another if the locations are close. A 1-hour spell usually lasts for several encounters.\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Before A Fight</title>Casting advantageous spells before a fight (sometimes called “pre-buffing”) gives the characters a big advantage, since they can spend more combat rounds on offensive actions instead of preparatory ones. If the players have the drop on their foes, you usually can let each character cast one spell or prepare in some similar way, then roll initiative.\n\nCasting preparatory spells before combat becomes a problem when it feels rote and the players assume it will always work—that sort of planning can't hold up in every situation! In many cases, the act of casting spells gives away the party's presence. In cases where the PCs' preparations could give them away, you might roll for initiative before everyone can complete their preparations.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Quick Environmental Details</title>\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Aquatic</title>**Sights** choppy water, rolling waves, sunlight glinting, the curve of the horizon, driftwood<br />**Sounds** waves lapping against a ship, seabirds' cries, fluttering sails, creatures breaching the surface<br />**Smells** salt water, crisp fresh air, dead fish<br />**Textures** frigid water, slimy seaweed, crusty salt collecting on surfaces<br />**Weather** powerful winds, oncoming storms<br />\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Arctic</title>**Sights** blinding reflected sunlight, snowy plains, distant glaciers, deep crevasses, rocky cliffs, ice floes and bergs, animal tracks in snow<br />**Sounds** howling winds, drips of melting ice, utter quiet<br />**Smells** clean air, half-frozen bog, lichen, seaweed<br />**Textures** crunching snow, hard ice<br />**Weather** frigid gales, light snowfall, pounding blizzards<br />\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Forest</title>**Sights** towering trees, dense undergrowth, verdant canopies, colorful wildlife, dappled sunlight through the trees, mossy tree trunks, twisted roots<br />**Sounds** rustling leaves, snapping branches, animal calls<br />**Smells** decomposing vegetation, flowering plants, pine trees, earthy mushrooms<br />**Textures** leaves crunching underfoot, scraping branches, water dripping from above, rough bark<br />**Weather** still air, cool shade, sporadic breeze, rain on the canopy, branches coated in thick snow<br />\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Mountain</title>**Sights** bare cliffs, snow caps, hardy trees, slopes littered with scree, birds flying on currents, fog among the peaks<br />**Sounds** howling wind, falling rocks, clear echoes, crunch of rocks underfoot, distant avalanche<br />**Smells** blowing dust, pine trees, fresh snow<br />**Textures** rough stone, powdery snow, unstable rubble<br />**Weather** swirling clouds, chill of high altitude, direct sunlight, powerful wind and rain<br />\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Plains</title>**Sights** grass waving gently, scattered wildflowers, rocky outcroppings or boulders, the curve of the horizon<br />**Sounds** rustling wind, birdsong, distant sounds carried far<br />**Smells** fresh air, earthy soil, distant carcasses<br />**Textures** touch of tall grass, rasp of scrub brush, crunch of dry dirt<br />**Weather** cooling of gentle wind, heat of direct sunlight, massive black thunderclouds<br />\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Swamp</title>**Sights** lush leaves, clouds of gnats, algae-coated water, shacks on stilts, darting fish<br />**Sounds** croaking frogs, chirping insects, bubbling, splashing<br />**Smells** rich moss and algae, pungent swamp gases<br />**Textures** pushing through floating detritus, tangling creepers, thick mud<br />**Weather** oppressive humidity, still air, pouring rain, rays of sunlight<br />\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Underground</title>**Sights** winding passages, sputtering yellow torchlight, uneven or cracked floors, ancient writings or architecture, stalagmites and stalactites<br />**Sounds** dripping condensation, scurrying rats or insects, distant clunks of machinery, tinny echoes of your voices and footsteps<br />**Smells** staleness of still air, sulfur, tang of metal deposits<br />**Textures** rough rock walls, erosion-smoothed stone, cobwebs<br />**Weather** chill of underground air, geothermal heat\r\n</aside>",

There are two times these durations matter most: when players try to fit multiple encounters within the duration of a spell, and when they want to use a spell before a fight and keep it in effect during the encounter. Multiple Encounters A 1-minute spell should last for multiple encounters only if the encounters happen in very close proximity (usually in two adjoining rooms) and if the PCs go directly from one fight to the next without leaving encounter mode. If they want to stop and heal, or if the party debates whether to go on, the process takes enough time that the spell runs out. Be more generous with spells lasting 10 minutes or more. A 10-minute spell easily lasts for one encounter and could continue for another if the locations are close. A 1-hour spell usually lasts for several encounters.

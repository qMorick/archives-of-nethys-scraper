Playing through the process of wandering in the wilderness and trying to find their way can be fun for a party, provided they do so for a fairly short interval. If a party is lost at the start of a session, they should usually have found their way and reached a significant destination by the end.\n\nIf the PCs get unlucky or are just awful at Survival, they might end up stuck with no way to reorient themselves.

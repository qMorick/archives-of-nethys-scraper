The most common ways are via empathy, speech, and telepathy. Speech and telepathy function as they do for any creature, while an empathic connection allows the item to share only emotions. Empathic and telepathic connections are often limited either to the item’s partner or to a certain distance. If an intelligent item understands or speaks any languages, they are listed in parentheses in its Communication entry.

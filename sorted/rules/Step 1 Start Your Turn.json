At the start of each of your turns, take these steps in any order you choose: If you created an effect lasting for a certain number of rounds, reduce the number of rounds remaining by 1. The effect ends if the duration is reduced to 0. For example, if you cast a spell that lasts 3 rounds on yourself during your first turn of a fight, it would affect you during that turn, decrease to 2 rounds of duration at the start of your second turn, decrease to 1 round of duration at the start of your third turn, and expire at the start of your fourth turn. You can use 1 free action or reaction with a trigger of “Your turn begins” or something similar. If you're dying, roll a recovery check. Do anything else that is specified to happen at the start of your turn, such as regaining Hit Points from fast healing or regeneration. The last step of starting your turn is always the same. Regain your 3 actions and 1 reaction. If you haven't spent your reaction from your last turn, you lose it—you can't “save” actions or reactions from one turn to use during the next turn. Some abilities or conditions (such as quickened, slowed, and stunned) can change how many actions you regain and whether you regain your reaction. (Details on gaining and losing actions.) Tracking Initiative The GM keeps track of the initiative order for an encounter. It's usually okay for the players to know this order, since they'll see who goes when and be aware of one another's results. However, the GM might want to conceal information about adversaries the PCs have yet to detect or identify. Once the encounter's order is set, it's usually not necessary to track the original initiative numbers. The GM can create a simple list, use a series of cards or other indicators, or use a Pathfinder Combat Pad, which has magnetic markers to allow for easily rearranging the order. Changing The Initiative Order Any method used to track the initiative order needs to be flexible because the order can change. A creature can use the Delay basic action to change its place in the order, in which case you can erase it from the list or pull its marker aside until it reenters the initiative order. When a creature gets knocked out, its initiative order also changes (see Getting Knocked Out). Using the Ready basic action doesn't change a creature's place in the initiative order, though, because the designated action becomes a reaction. ",

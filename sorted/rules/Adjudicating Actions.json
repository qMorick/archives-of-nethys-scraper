Here, you’ll find advice on the types of rules calls that can occur frequently. For rules decisions that are either/or (such as whether a creature can Aid or Take Cover), a PC can usually determine before they take the action whether doing so is viable; if it isn’t viable for some reason, alert them that it won’t work before they spend time, actions, or resources trying. There are some exceptions, especially if the reason an action wouldn’t work is something a character wouldn’t know. For example, if a character tries to Take Cover behind a wall, not realizing it’s illusory, you shouldn’t reveal the deception prematurely.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2552\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2553\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2554\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2555\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2556\" />",

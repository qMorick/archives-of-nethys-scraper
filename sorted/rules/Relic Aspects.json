The individual gifts each have an associated aspect. You should almost always select gifts that have an aspect matching one of those found on the relic. For example, a brass dagger recovered from the [Medina Mudii'a](/Planes.aspx?ID=31) might have the [fire](/Relics.aspx?Aspect=7) and [mind](/Relics.aspx?Aspect=9) aspects, which means that it could have the [flare bolt](/Relics.aspx?ID=160) gift (which has the fire aspect), but not the [rolling geode](/Relics.aspx?ID=149) gift (which has the [earth](/Relics.aspx?Aspect=5) aspect).\n\nUsually, you can determine at least one aspect of a relic easily by looking at the history of the item or personality of the character. For example, if a player decides that their background relic is a rusty mace wielded by the character's great grandmother in battle against rising undead hordes, the mace might have the [life](/Relics.aspx?Aspect=8) aspect, as it was used to slay countless undead creatures. There's no harm in letting the player choose an aspect for a background relic; through play, the item will reveal another aspect associated with it. In the previous example, the mace might reveal itself to have powers against demons as well, in which case its aspects might be [celestial](/Relics.aspx?Aspect=3) and life.\n\n[Click here for the Relic Aspects category page](Relics.aspx).\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-3253\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-3254\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-3255\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-3256\" />",

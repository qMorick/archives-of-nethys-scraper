Without some structure to bind multiple disparate spells to a single staff, the magic would surely fail. Thus, a custom staff must always be created around a single trait. For example, an elemental trait ([air](/Traits.aspx?ID=5), [earth](/Traits.aspx?ID=55), [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72), or [water](/Traits.aspx?ID=165)), energy trait ([acid](/Traits.aspx?ID=3), [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27), [electricity](/Traits.aspx?ID=56), fire, [sonic](/Traits.aspx?ID=147), [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128), [negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118), or [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=75)), alignment trait, the [detection](/Traits.aspx?ID=43) trait, the [light](/Traits.aspx?ID=100) trait, and so on. The staff and its spells must have the trait. A few traits are too broad to use, including [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93) and the traits for spell schools and traditions. The GM might add others to this list.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1501\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1502\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1504\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1506\" />",

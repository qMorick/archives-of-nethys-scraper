On Earth, these geological features are the result of plate tectonics. In a fantasy world, however, the oceans might have been cleaved from the land by the actions of titans, or the continents shaped to suit a god's whims. The following are some common landmass types. Archipelago: A stretch of vast ocean, dotted by chains of small island groups, atolls, and islets. Major Islands: A region of seas dominated by large islands, each several hundred miles across. Island-Continent: An enormous island nearly the size of a continent, surrounded by ocean. Continent: A substantial landform that (usually) rests on a tectonic plate and gradually shifts in position over geologic timescales. Supercontinent: An assembly of the world's continental blocks into a single immense landmass. ",

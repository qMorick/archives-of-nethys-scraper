Find the level of the subject, and assign the corresponding DC. Since spells use a 1–10 scale, use the Spell Rank column for them.\n\nUse these DCs when a PC needs to Identify a Spell or Recall Knowledge about a creature, attempts to Earn Income by performing a task of a certain level, and so on. You can also use the level-based DCs for obstacles instead of assigning a simple DC. For example, you might determine that a wall in a high-level dungeon was constructed of smooth metal and is hard to climb. You could simply say only someone with master proficiency could climb it and use the simple DC of 30. Or you might decide that the 15th-level villain who created the dungeon crafted the wall and use the 15th-level DC of 34. Either approach is reasonable!\n\nNote that PCs who invest in a skill become more likely to succeed at a DC of their level as they increase in level, and the listed DCs eventually pose very little challenge for them.\n\n## DCs by Level\n<row gap=\"tiny\"><table style=\"float: left\"> <tr><td>**Level**</td><td>**DC**</td></tr> <tr><td>0</td><td>14</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>16</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>18</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>19</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>20</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>22</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>23</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>24</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>26</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>27</td></tr> <tr><td>11</td><td>28</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>30</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>31</td></tr> <tr><td>14</td><td>32</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>34</td></tr> <tr><td>16</td><td>35</td></tr> <tr><td>17</td><td>36</td></tr> <tr><td>18</td><td>38</td></tr> <tr><td>19</td><td>39</td></tr> <tr><td>20</td><td>40</td></tr> <tr><td>21</td><td>42</td></tr> <tr><td>22</td><td>44</td></tr> <tr><td>23</td><td>46</td></tr> <tr><td>24</td><td>48</td></tr> <tr><td>25</td><td>50</td></tr></table><table style=\"float: left\"><tr><td>**Spell Rank***</td><td>**DC**</td></tr> <tr><td>1st</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>2nd</td><td>18</td></tr> <tr><td>3rd</td><td>20</td></tr> <tr><td>4th</td><td>23</td></tr> <tr><td>5th</td><td>26</td></tr> <tr><td>6th</td><td>28</td></tr> <tr><td>7th</td><td>31</td></tr> <tr><td>8th</td><td>34</td></tr> <tr><td>9th</td><td>36</td></tr> <tr><td>10th</td><td>39</td></tr><tfoot><tr><td colspan=\"2\">*If the spell is uncommon or rare, its<br />difficulty should be adjusted accordingly</td></tr></tfoot> </table>\n\n </row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

Choosing your character's class is perhaps the most important decision you will make for them. Groups of players often create characters whose skills and abilities complement each other mechanically—for example, ensuring your party includes a healer, a combat-oriented character, a stealthy character, and someone with command over magic—so you may wish to discuss options with your group before deciding.\n\nThe rules within each class allow you to bring a wealth of character concepts to life. Perhaps you want to create a brilliant but scatterbrained wizard who can rattle off complex formulas for magic items but has trouble remembering his best friend's birthday. Or perhaps you want your character to be a muscle?bound swordswoman who becomes as immovable as a mountain when she hoists a shield. Maybe they'll be a hot?tempered witch whose gesticulating fingers pulse with power granted through dealings with a mysterious patron. The choices you make for your character within their class—such as a cleric's choice of deity, a fighter's choice of weapon, or a school where a wizard studied—bring these visions to life within the context of the rules and the world.\n\nThe entries on the pages that follow describe 8 classes in Pathfinder. Each entry contains the information you need to play a character of that class, as well as how to develop them from their humble beginnings at 1st level to the dizzying heights of power at 20th level.

Leaving town via horseback, following the trail of a marauding orc tribe, avoiding the tribe's scouts, and convincing a local hunter to help in an upcoming fight are all examples of things that might occur during exploration.\n\nThroughout this mode of play, the GM asks the players what their characters are doing as they explore.

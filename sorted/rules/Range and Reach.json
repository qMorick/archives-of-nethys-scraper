Most spells and abilities list a **range**—the maximum distance from the creature or object creating the effect in which the effect can occur.\n\nRanged and [thrown](/Traits.aspx?ID=711) weapons have a **range increment**. Attacks with such weapons work normally up to that range. Attacks against targets beyond that range take a –2 penalty, which worsens by 2 for every additional multiple of that range, to a maximum of a –10 penalty after five additional range increments. Attacks beyond this range are not possible. For example, using a [shortbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=437), your attacks take no penalty against a target up to 60 feet away, a –2 penalty if a target is over 60 and up to 120 feet away, a –4 if they're over 120 and up to 180 feet away, and so on, up to a maximum of 360 feet.\n\n**Reach** is how far you can physically reach with your body or a weapon. Melee Strikes rely on reach. Your reach is typically 5 feet, but weapons with the [reach](/Traits.aspx?ID=684) trait can extend this. Larger creatures can have greater reach; for instance, an [ogre](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=451) has a 10-foot reach. Unlike with measuring most distances, 10-foot reach can reach 2 squares diagonally. Reach greater than 10 feet is measured normally: 20-foot reach can reach 3 squares diagonally, 30-foot reach can reach 4, and so on.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

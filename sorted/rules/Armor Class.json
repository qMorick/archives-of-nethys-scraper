Low AC typically fits spellcasters, who compensate with their selection of powerful spells. Most creatures use high or moderate AC—high is comparable to what a PC fighter would have. Reserve extreme AC for a creature that is even better defended; these values are for creatures that have defenses similar in power to those of a champion or monk.\n\n## Table 2–5: Armor Class\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Level**</td><td>**Extreme**</td><td>**High**</td><td>**Moderate**</td><td>**Low**</td></tr> <tr><td>–1</td><td>18</td><td>15</td><td>14</td><td>12</td></tr> <tr><td>0</td><td>19</td><td>16</td><td>15</td><td>13</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>19</td><td>16</td><td>15</td><td>13</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>21</td><td>18</td><td>17</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>22</td><td>19</td><td>18</td><td>16</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>24</td><td>21</td><td>20</td><td>18</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>25</td><td>22</td><td>21</td><td>19</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>27</td><td>24</td><td>23</td><td>21</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>28</td><td>25</td><td>24</td><td>22</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>30</td><td>27</td><td>26</td><td>24</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>31</td><td>28</td><td>27</td><td>25</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>33</td><td>30</td><td>29</td><td>27</td></tr> <tr><td>11</td><td>34</td><td>31</td><td>30</td><td>28</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>36</td><td>33</td><td>32</td><td>30</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>37</td><td>34</td><td>33</td><td>31</td></tr> <tr><td>14</td><td>39</td><td>36</td><td>35</td><td>33</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>40</td><td>37</td><td>36</td><td>34</td></tr> <tr><td>16</td><td>42</td><td>39</td><td>38</td><td>36</td></tr> <tr><td>17</td><td>43</td><td>40</td><td>39</td><td>37</td></tr> <tr><td>18</td><td>45</td><td>42</td><td>41</td><td>39</td></tr> <tr><td>19</td><td>46</td><td>43</td><td>42</td><td>40</td></tr> <tr><td>20</td><td>48</td><td>45</td><td>44</td><td>42</td></tr> <tr><td>21</td><td>49</td><td>46</td><td>45</td><td>43</td></tr> <tr><td>22</td><td>51</td><td>48</td><td>47</td><td>45</td></tr> <tr><td>23</td><td>52</td><td>49</td><td>48</td><td>46</td></tr> <tr><td>24</td><td>54</td><td>51</td><td>50</td><td>48</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Improvising a Creature</title>\r\n\r\nAs you get more experienced, you might find that you don’t need to build some creatures in advance. In many cases, especially for simple creatures, you can just select values from the relevant tables on the fly and track its HP. When you do, track which value you used as it came up. For instance, let’s say you’re improvising a 2nd-level kobold soldier. When it’s time for initiative, you decide it has moderate Perception and jot down “Per +8.” Your group’s fighter beats it at initiative and attacks. You decide the soldier has high AC—looking at the Armor Class table, you see that’s 18—and add this information to your note. The fighter’s Strike hits, and you select the low end of high HP: 36. Well, now it’s 25. Your note says “Per +8, AC 18, HP 25.” If it gets to take a turn, you can give it a Strike then.\r\n</aside>",

The sizes and the spaces they each take up on a grid are listed in the Size and Reach table (see below). The table also lists the typical reach for creatures of each size, for both tall creatures (most bipeds) and long creatures (most quadrupeds). See [here](/Rules.aspx?ID=2379) for more about reach.\n\nThe Space entry lists how many feet on a side a creature's space is, so a Large creature fills a 10-foot-by- 10-foot space, or 4 squares on the grid. (If you need to measure in three dimensions, their space is also 10 feet high.) Sometimes part of a creature extends beyond its space, such as if a giant octopus is grabbing you with its tentacles. In that case, the GM will usually allow attacking the extended portion, even if you can't reach the main creature.\n\n## Table 9-1: Size and Reach\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Size**</td><td>**Space**</td><td>**Reach (Tall)**</td><td>**Reach (Long)**</td></tr> <tr><td>Tiny</td><td>Less than 5 feet</td><td>0 feet</td><td>0 feet</td></tr> <tr><td>Small</td><td>5 feet</td><td>5 feet</td><td>5 feet</td></tr> <tr><td>Medium</td><td>5 feet</td><td>5 feet</td><td>5 feet</td></tr> <tr><td>Large</td><td>10 feet</td><td>10 feet</td><td>5 feet</td></tr> <tr><td>Huge</td><td>15 feet</td><td>15 feet</td><td>10 feet</td></tr> <tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>20 feet or more</td><td>20 feet</td><td>15 feet</td></tr> </table></row><br />A Small or larger creature or object takes up at least 1 square on a grid, and creatures of these sizes can't usually share spaces except in situations like a character riding a mount.\n\nMultiple Tiny creatures can occupy the same square.

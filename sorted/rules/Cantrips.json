Casting a cantrip doesn't use up your spell slots; you can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. If you're a prepared caster, you can prepare a specific number of cantrips each day. You can't prepare a cantrip in a spell slot.\n\nA cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level, rounded up.

When given a range of skills for an activity or event, you should vary the difficulty based on the needs of the story. For instance, if a PC is Scouting a Location, you might want to use a low DC for Stealth (because it’s easier to scout when unnoticed), a hard one for Perception (because while the PC might see the enemy, the enemy might also see them), and a very hard DC for Society (because walking in like you belong is difficult if you don’t have an invitation or the right uniform). This not only adds a certain degree of plausibility, but by planning for and allowing a broad range of skills as a means to complete the activity, you also become better prepared for when your players improvise.\r\n</aside>",

You can also use the sample chase obstacles on page 195 as starting points. Guard Post Infiltration Points 2 (individual); Overcome standard, hard, or very hard Deception, Diplomacy, or Stealth Guards cluster at a checkpoint, alert for unusual activity. Locked Door Infiltration Points 1 (group); Overcome hard or very hard Athletics or Thievery A locked door separates the heroes from their target. Trap Infiltration Points 3 (group); Overcome hard or very hard Thievery A trap bars the characters' passage. This obstacle follows the normal degrees of success for an obstacle, with the following modification for critical failure. Critical Failure The PCs accrue 2 AP as normal, and the PC who critically fails the Thievery check also triggers the trap.

The easiest method is to select a simple DC from the Simple DCs table on page 53 by estimating which proficiency rank best matches the task (that rank is usually not required to succeed at the task). If it's something pretty much anyone would have a decent chance at, use the untrained DC. If it would require a degree of training, use the DC listed for trained, expert, master, or legendary proficiency, as appropriate to the complexity of the task. For example, say a PC was trying to uncover the true history behind a fable. You determine this requires a check to Recall Knowledge, and that only someone with master proficiency in Folktale Lore would know the information, so you'd set the DC at 30—the simple master DC.\n\nSimple DCs work well when you need a DC on the fly and there's no level associated with the task. They're most useful for skill checks. Because there isn't much gradation between the simple DCs, they don't work as well for hazards or combats where the PCs' lives are on the line; you're better off using level-based DCs for such challenges.\n\n## Table 10-4: Simple DCs\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Proficiency Rank**</td><td>**DC**</td></tr> <tr><td>Untrained</td><td>10</td></tr> <tr><td>Trained</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>Expert</td><td>20</td></tr> <tr><td>Master</td><td>30</td></tr> <tr><td>Legendary</td><td>40</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

An item has a Hardness statistic that reduces damage the item takes by that amount. The item then takes any damage left over. If an item is reduced to 0 HP, it’s destroyed. An item also has a Broken Threshold. If its HP are reduced to this amount or lower, it’s [broken](/Conditions.aspx?ID=60), meaning it can’t be used for its normal function and it doesn’t grant bonuses. You usually can’t attack an attended object (one on a creature’s person).\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

For instance, say you’re considering giving a 6th-level creature the ability to teleport a short distance. [_Translocate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1724) is comparable—that’s a 4th-rank spell, normally cast by a 7th-level or higher creature. That means 6th level probably isn’t too low, but the creature shouldn’t be able to use the ability more than once.

[Auras](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=5) are a common constant ability, with [frightful presence](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=17), the [cinder rat](/Monsters.aspx?ID=187)'s fetid fumes, and the [xulgath](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=102)'s stench as notable examples. An aura needs a range, and if it needs a DC, you'll usually set it to the moderate spell DC unless the aura is one of the creature's defining concepts. For example, the xulgath's stench DC is significantly higher because the aura is such an iconic part of the creature.\n\nAbilities the creature has no control over should be automatic. For example, the [living wildfire](/Monsters.aspx?ID=188) fire elemental explodes into flames when it dies. It has no option not to, so this wouldn't make sense as a reaction or free action. Conversely, the [Ferocity](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=16) ability is a reaction because it requires the creature to give itself a last push to stay at 1 HP.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2915\" />",

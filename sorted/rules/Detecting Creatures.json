However, the [concealed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=62) and [invisible](/Conditions.aspx?ID=83) conditions can partially mask a creature, and the [unnoticed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=98) condition indicates you have no idea a creature is around.\n\nWith the exception of invisible, these conditions are relative to the viewer—it's possible for a creature to be observed to you but hidden from your ally. Most of these rules apply to objects as well as creatures.\n\nTypically, the GM tracks how well creatures detect each other, since neither party has perfect information. For example, you might think a creature is in the last place you sensed it, but it was able to [Sneak](/Actions.aspx?ID=2405) away. Or you might think a creature can't see you in the dark, but it has [darkvision](/Rules.aspx?ID=2410).\n\nYou can attempt to avoid detection by using the [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=48) skill to [Avoid Notice](/Actions.aspx?ID=2622), [Hide](/Actions.aspx?ID=2404), or [Sneak](/Actions.aspx?ID=2405), or by using [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=38) to [Create a Diversion](/Actions.aspx?ID=2387).\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2415\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2416\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2417\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2418\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2419\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2420\" />",

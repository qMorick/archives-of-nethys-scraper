These runes allow for in-depth customization of items.\n\nRunes must be physically engraved on items through a special process to convey their effects. They take two forms: fundamental runes and property runes. Fundamental runes offer the most basic and essential benefits: a [weapon potency](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2830) rune adds a bonus to a weapon's attack rolls, and the [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2829) rune adds extra weapon damage dice. An [armor potency](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2785) rune increases the armor's item bonus to AC, and the [resilient](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2786) rune grants a bonus to the wearer's saving throws. A [reinforcing rune](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2811) increases a shield's durability. Property runes, by contrast, grant more varied effects—typically powers that take effect each time the weapon is used or that are constant while the armor is worn, such as a rune that grants [energy resistance](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2788) or one that adds [fire damage](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2838) to a weapon's attacks.\n\nThe number of property runes a weapon or armor can have is equal to the value of its potency rune. A _+1 weapon_ can have one property rune, but it could hold another if the _+1 weapon potency rune_ were upgraded to a _+2 weapon potency rune_. Since the striking and resilient runes are fundamental runes, they don't count against this limit. A shield can't have property runes, only a _reinforcing rune_.\n\nAn item with runes is typically referred to by the value of its potency rune, followed by any other fundamental runes, then the names of any property runes, and ends with the name of the base item. For example, you might have a _+1 [longsword](/Weapons.aspx?ID=386)_ or _+2 greater resilient fire-resistant [chain mail](/Armor.aspx?ID=46)_.\n\nRune-etched items have the same Bulk and general characteristics as the non-magical version unless noted otherwise. The level of an item with runes etched onto it is equal to the highest level among the base item and all runes etched on it; therefore, a _+1 striking [mace](/Weapons.aspx?ID=362)_ (a 4th-level item) with a _[frost rune](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2839)_ (an 8th-level rune) would be an 8th-level item.\n\nEach rune can be etched into a specific type of armor, shield, or weapon, as indicated in the Usage entry of the rune's stat block. [Explorer's clothing](/Armor.aspx?ID=39) can have armor runes etched on it even though it's not armor, but because it's not in the light, medium, or heavy armor category, it can't have runes requiring any of those categories.\n\n## Fundamental Runes\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table><tr><td>**Fundamental Rune**</td><td>**Etched Onto**</td><td>**Benefit**</td></tr> <tr><td>_Armor potency_</td><td>Armor</td><td>Increase item bonus to AC and determine maximum number of property runes</td></tr><tr><td>_Resilient_</td><td>Armor</td><td>Grant item bonus to saves</td></tr> <tr><td>_Reinforcing_</td><td>Shield</td><td>Increase Hardness, HP, and BT</td></tr> <tr><td>_Weapon potency_</td><td>Weapon</td><td>Grant an item bonus to attack rolls and determine maximum number of  property runes</td></tr><tr><td>_Striking_</td><td>Weapon</td><td>Increase weapon damage dice</td></tr> </table></row><br />\n\n## Table 11-6: Armor Upgrade Prices\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table><tr><td>**Starting Armor**</td><td>**Improved Armor**</td><td>**Price and Process**</td></tr> <tr><td>_+1 armor_</td><td>_+1 [resilient](/Equipment.aspx?ID=279) armor_</td><td>340 gp to etch _resilient_ (8th level)</td></tr> <tr><td>_+1 resilient armor_</td><td>_+2 resilient armor_</td><td>900 gp to etch _+2 armor potency_ (11th level)</td></tr> <tr><td>_+2 resilient armor_</td><td>_+2 greater resilient armor_</td><td>3,100 gp to etch _greater resilient_ (14th level)</td></tr> <tr><td>_+2 greater resilient armor_</td><td>_+3 greater resilient armor_</td><td>19,500 gp to etch _+3 armor potency_ (18th level)</td></tr> <tr><td>_+3 greater resilient armor_</td><td>_+3 major resilient armor_</td><td>46,000 gp to etch _major resilient_ (20th level)</td></tr></table></row><br />\n\n## Table 11-7: Weapon Upgrade Prices\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table><tr><td>**Starting Weapon**</td><td>**Improved Weapon**</td><td>**Price and Process**</td></tr> <tr><td>_+1 weapon_</td><td>_+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) weapon_</td><td>65 gp to etch _striking_ (4th level)</td></tr> <tr><td>_+1 striking weapon_</td><td>_+2 striking weapon_</td><td> 900 gp to etch _+2 weapon potency_ (10th level)</td></tr> <tr><td>_+2 striking weapon_</td><td>_+2 greater striking weapon_</td><td> 1,000 gp to etch _greater striking_ (12th level)</td></tr> <tr><td>_+2 greater striking weapon_</td><td>_+3 greater striking weapon_</td><td> 8,000 gp to etch _+3 weapon potency_ (16th level)</td></tr> <tr><td>_+3 greater striking weapon_</td><td>_+3 major striking weapon_</td><td> 30,000 gp to etch _major striking_ (19th level)</td></tr></table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Upgrading Runes</title>\r\n\r\nYou’ll often want to upgrade the fundamental runes of magic armor, a magic shield, or a magic weapon you already have.

Some creatures might vary from this, either because they have poor AC but better saves or because they should thematically have multiple good saves and compensate elsewhere. You have more flexibility with saves, and having one save be 1 more or 1 less than the listed number is rarely a big deal. Pay attention to the creature's Con, Dex, and Wis modifiers—these don't have to correspond to the creature's saves exactly, but should inform your choices.\n\nExtreme saves often pair with extreme or high attribute modifiers. Almost no creature should have more than one extreme save, even at high levels. Assign terrible saves to creatures that have a clear weak point—for example, a nearly immobile creature would have a terrible Reflex save.\n\n## Table 2–6: Saving Throws\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Level**</td><td>**Extreme**</td><td>**High**</td><td>**Moderate**</td><td>**Low**</td><td>**Terrible**</td></tr> <tr><td>–1</td><td>+9</td><td>+8</td><td>+5</td><td>+2</td><td>+0</td></tr> <tr><td>0</td><td>+10</td><td>+9</td><td>+6</td><td>+3</td><td>+1</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>+11</td><td>+10</td><td>+7</td><td>+4</td><td>+2</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>+12</td><td>+11</td><td>+8</td><td>+5</td><td>+3</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>+14</td><td>+12</td><td>+9</td><td>+6</td><td>+4</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>+15</td><td>+14</td><td>+11</td><td>+8</td><td>+6</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>+17</td><td>+15</td><td>+12</td><td>+9</td><td>+7</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>+18</td><td>+17</td><td>+14</td><td>+11</td><td>+8</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>+20</td><td>+18</td><td>+15</td><td>+12</td><td>+10</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>+21</td><td>+19</td><td>+16</td><td>+13</td><td>+11</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>+23</td><td>+21</td><td>+18</td><td>+15</td><td>+12</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>+24</td><td>+22</td><td>+19</td><td>+16</td><td>+14</td></tr> <tr><td>11</td><td>+26</td><td>+24</td><td>+21</td><td>+18</td><td>+15</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>+27</td><td>+25</td><td>+22</td><td>+19</td><td>+16</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>+29</td><td>+26</td><td>+23</td><td>+20</td><td>+18</td></tr> <tr><td>14</td><td>+30</td><td>+28</td><td>+25</td><td>+22</td><td>+19</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>+32</td><td>+29</td><td>+26</td><td>+23</td><td>+20</td></tr> <tr><td>16</td><td>+33</td><td>+30</td><td>+28</td><td>+25</td><td>+22</td></tr> <tr><td>17</td><td>+35</td><td>+32</td><td>+29</td><td>+26</td><td>+23</td></tr> <tr><td>18</td><td>+36</td><td>+33</td><td>+30</td><td>+27</td><td>+24</td></tr> <tr><td>19</td><td>+38</td><td>+35</td><td>+32</td><td>+29</td><td>+26</td></tr> <tr><td>20</td><td>+39</td><td>+36</td><td>+33</td><td>+30</td><td>+27</td></tr> <tr><td>21</td><td>+41</td><td>+38</td><td>+35</td><td>+32</td><td>+28</td></tr> <tr><td>22</td><td>+43</td><td>+39</td><td>+36</td><td>+33</td><td>+30</td></tr> <tr><td>23</td><td>+44</td><td>+40</td><td>+37</td><td>+34</td><td>+31</td></tr> <tr><td>24</td><td>+46</td><td>+42</td><td>+38</td><td>+36</td><td>+32</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

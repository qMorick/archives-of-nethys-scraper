Doing so requires an amount of time noted in the missive’s description, but is typically 2 actions—one to open the missive or arrange it in their hands ([manipulate](/Traits.aspx?ID=645)) and the other to absorb part of the contents ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561)). A missive doesn’t have to be read or examined in its entirety to be activated, nor does a creature need to know the missive is magical to Activate it. One can Activate missives unintentionally! The creature does need to be able to understand the missive to Activate it, however—a creature who speaks only [Sakvroth](/Languages.aspx?ID=118) couldn’t Activate a missive in [Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=155). Someone who knows they hold a missive can avoid Activating it by not examining it, and possibly by Interacting to close it, if it’s open.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

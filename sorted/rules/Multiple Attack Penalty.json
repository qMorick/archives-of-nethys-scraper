Every check that has the [attack](/Traits.aspx?ID=540) trait counts toward your multiple attack penalty, including [Strikes](/Actions.aspx?ID=2306), spell attack rolls, certain skill actions like [Shove](/Actions.aspx?ID=2380), and many others.\n\nSome weapons and abilities reduce multiple attack penalties, such as [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=526) weapons, which reduce these penalties to –4 on the second attack or –8 on further attacks.\n\n## Multiple Attack Penalty\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Attack**</td><td>**Multiple Attack Penalty**</td><td>**Agile**</td></tr> <tr><td>First</td><td>None</td><td>None</td></tr> <tr><td>Second</td><td>-5</td><td>-4</td></tr> <tr><td>Third and subsequent</td><td>-10</td><td>-8</td></tr> </table></row><br />Always calculate your multiple attack penalty based on the weapon you're using on that attack, not ones you used on previous attacks.

The first Strike you make during your turn has no penalty, no matter what weapon you are using. The second Strike will take either a –5 penalty if you use the longsword or a –4 penalty if you use the shortsword. Your third attack would be a –10 penalty with the longsword and a –8 penalty with the shortsword, no matter what weapon you used for your previous Strikes.\n\nThe multiple attack penalty applies only during your turn, so you don't have to keep track of it if you can perform a [Reactive Strike](/Actions.aspx?ID=2256) or a similar reaction that lets you make a Strike on someone else's turn.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

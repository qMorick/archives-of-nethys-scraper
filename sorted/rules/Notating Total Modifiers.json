For instance, if you are using a weapon with a [_+1 weapon potency_ rune](/Equipment.aspx?ID=281), you’ll want to add the +1 item bonus to your notation for your attack rolls with that weapon, since you will include that bonus every time you attack with that weapon. But if you have a [fine spyglass](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2754), you wouldn’t add its item bonus to your Perception check notation, since you gain that bonus only if you are using sight—and the spyglass!—to see long distances.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

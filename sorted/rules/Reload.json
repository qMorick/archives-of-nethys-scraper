This can be 0 if drawing ammunition and firing or throwing the weapon are part of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions to reload, the GM determines whether they must be performed together as an activity, or you can spend some of those actions during one turn and the rest during your next turn.\n\nAn item with an entry of “—” must be drawn to be thrown, which usually takes an Interact action just like drawing any other weapon.

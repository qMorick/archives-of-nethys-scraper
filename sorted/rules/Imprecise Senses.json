You can usually sense a creature automatically with an imprecise sense, but it has the [hidden](/Conditions.aspx?ID=79) condition instead of the [observed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=84) condition. It might be [undetected](/Rules.aspx?ID=2417) by you if it’s using [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=48) or is in an environment that distorts the sense, such as a noisy room in the case of hearing. In those cases, you have to use the [Seek](/Actions.aspx?ID=2301) basic action to detect the creature. At best, an imprecise sense can be used to make an undetected creature (or one you didn’t even know was there) merely hidden—it can’t make the creature observed.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

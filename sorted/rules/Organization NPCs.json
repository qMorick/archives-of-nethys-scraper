When an organization has followers or lieutenants of several levels, most of them are at the lowest possible level. As a rule of thumb, an organization has twice as many NPCs of a given level than of the next-higher level. This allows you to quickly estimate the level composition of the organization's members, but you can of course change the levels of various followers as much as you like. When the minimum level for lieutenants increases, either the lower-level lieutenants level up to the new minimum, or they become followers of more powerful lieutenants the PCs recruit, whichever fits best with the story.\n\nFollowers and lieutenants are loyal to the PCs and their organization, working to maintain the organization, its base of operations, and their own way of life. Because of this work, PCs don't need to pay for basic upkeep of their base of operations or for expansions to house the burgeoning activity as their organization grows in level— the followers and lieutenants take care of all of that. But similarly, these followers and lieutenants never get involved in the PCs' adventuring, nor do they provide a source of free magic or labor.\n\n## Table 3–3: Organization Statistics by Level\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Level**</td><td>**Followers**</td><td>**Max Follower Level**</td><td>**Lieutenants**</td><td>**Lieutenant Levels**</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>1–2</td><td>0</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>3–4</td><td>0</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>5–6</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>7–9</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>10–13</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>14–18</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>19–27</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>28–36</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>2–3</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>37–53</td><td>1</td><td>4–5</td><td>2–3</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>54–75</td><td>2</td><td>6–7</td><td>3–4</td></tr> <tr><td>11</td><td>76–99</td><td>2</td><td>8–10</td><td>3–4</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>100–150</td><td>2</td><td>11–15</td><td>3–5</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>151–215</td><td>2</td><td>16–22</td><td>3–5</td></tr> <tr><td>14</td><td>216–300</td><td>3</td><td>23–30</td><td>4–6</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>301–425</td><td>3</td><td>31–42</td><td>4–6</td></tr> <tr><td>16</td><td>426–600</td><td>3</td><td>43–60</td><td>4–7</td></tr> <tr><td>17</td><td>601–850</td><td>3</td><td>61–85</td><td>4–7</td></tr> <tr><td>18</td><td>851–1,200</td><td>4</td><td>86–120</td><td>5–8</td></tr> <tr><td>19</td><td>1,201–1,700</td><td>4</td><td>121–170</td><td>5–8</td></tr> <tr><td>20</td><td>1,701–2,400</td><td>4</td><td>171–240</td><td>5–9</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-3100\" />",

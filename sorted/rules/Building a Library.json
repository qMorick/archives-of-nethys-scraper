Despite the name, the library doesn’t necessarily consist of a quiet hall full of books. It could be an Astral memory palace, a collection of iconographic artwork, or even a group the party is questioning. In most cases, to engage the whole party and add a little decision-making to the research, you’ll want to give your research topic or library at least one variable or subdivision that the PCs need to decide how to handle. For instance, you might give the PCs three different research topics to study, each using different skills and providing different rewards. The library might have several rooms or sections with different challenges to research, allowing you to reward PCs with skills that aren’t typically associated with research; perhaps the books on aeromancy are all flying above the top shelves of towering bookcases, requiring a round of Athletics checks to represent climbing up and down ladders to retrieve them and reach the first threshold. A variety of skills and decisions, along with vivid descriptions, are the key to an engaging and memorable research session, rather than just a string of die rolls by the wizard.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1207\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-1208\" />",

For example, if you were trying to create a powerful bow that calls upon storms, you might need to find the heart of a tree burned by lightning, the scale of a [blue dragon](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=166), or even the breath of a powerful [air elemental](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=41). Alternatively, the component might be a person or place necessary for the crafting, like a woodcarver who survived a shipwreck, or a workshop located atop a mountain.

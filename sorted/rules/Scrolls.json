A scroll can be [Crafted](/Actions.aspx?ID=2385) to contain nearly any spell. The exceptions are [cantrips](/Rules.aspx?ID=2227), [focus spells](/Rules.aspx?ID=2228), and [rituals](/Rules.aspx?ID=2255), none of which can be put on scrolls. The spell on a scroll can be cast only once, and the scroll is destroyed as part of the casting. The spell on the scroll is cast at a particular spell rank, as determined by the scroll. For instance, a scroll of [_force barrage_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1536) (1st rank) can be used to cast the 1st-rank version of _force barrage_, but not a force barrage heightened to 2nd rank. If no rank is listed, the scroll can be used to cast the spell at its lowest rank.\n\nIf you find a scroll, you can try to figure out what spell it contains. If the spell is a common spell from your spell list or a spell you know, you can spend a single [Recall Knowledge](/Actions.aspx?ID=2367) action and automatically succeed at identifying the scroll's spell. If it's not, you must [Identify Magic](/Actions.aspx?ID=2365).\n\n[Click here for the Scrolls category page](/Equipment.aspx?Category=15&amp;Subcategory=52).\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-3198\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-3199\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-3201\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-3202\" />",

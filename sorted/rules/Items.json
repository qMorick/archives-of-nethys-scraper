Using the Safe Items table can help you avoid that. A creature can have a single permanent item of the listed level without issue. For example, if a 6th-level creature has a _[+1 weapon](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2861)_, that item's not worth enough that the PCs would be massively rich if they encountered many creatures of that type and sold everything they found. You can give a creature several lower-level items too. Just pay attention to your overall treasure as measured against the Safe Item table below. At the lowest levels, a creature can certainly have multiple level 0 items, even though normally a creature should have only one item of the level listed in the Safe Item Level column.\n\nSpecific creatures or NPCs have more leeway to break these guidelines because you can plan the rest of your adventure's loot around them. Also, giving a boss a powerful magic item makes the fight and its aftermath more interesting.\n\n## Table 2–4: Safe Items\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Creature Level**</td><td>**Safe Item Level**</td></tr> <tr><td>3 or lower</td><td>0</td></tr> <tr><td>4–5</td><td>1</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>2 (_+1 weapon_)</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>3</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>4 (_+1 striking weapon_)</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>5 (_+1 armor_)</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>6</td></tr> <tr><td>11</td><td>7</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>8 (_+1 resilient armor_)</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>9</td></tr> <tr><td>14</td><td>10 (_+2 striking weapon_)</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>11 (_+2 resilient armor_)</td></tr> <tr><td>16</td><td>12 (_+2 greater striking weapon_)</td></tr> <tr><td>17</td><td>13</td></tr> <tr><td>18</td><td>14 (_+2 greater resilient armor_)</td></tr> <tr><td>19</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>20</td><td>16 (_+3 greater striking weapon_)</td></tr> <tr><td>21</td><td>17</td></tr> <tr><td>22</td><td>18 (_+3 greater resilient armor_)</td></tr> <tr><td>23</td><td>19 (_+3 major striking weapon_)</td></tr> <tr><td>24</td><td>20 (_+3 major resilient armor_)</td></tr> </table></row>\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

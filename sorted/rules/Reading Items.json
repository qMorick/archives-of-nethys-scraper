Some specific categories of item have special traits—such as [elixir](/Traits.aspx?ID=589) or [scroll](/Traits.aspx?ID=688)—described in their sections.\n\n**[Alchemical](/Traits.aspx?ID=528):** Alchemical items are powered by the reactions of alchemical reagents. Alchemical items aren't magical, and they don't radiate a magical aura. Characters can [Craft](/Actions.aspx?ID=2385) these items only if they have the [Alchemical Crafting](/Feats.aspx?ID=5117) feat.\n\n**[Consumable](/Traits.aspx?ID=564):** An item with this trait can be used only once. Unless stated otherwise, it's destroyed after activation, though part of it might be recoverable for other purposes. For instance, while a potion is consumable, the vial it comes in is not destroyed when you drink it. Consumable items include most alchemical items as well as ammunition, oils, potions, scrolls, talismans, and other magical consumables.\n\nWhen a character creates consumable items, they can make them in batches of four, as described in the [Craft](/Actions.aspx?ID=2385) activity.\n\n**[Focused](/Traits.aspx?ID=609):** An item with this trait can give you an additional [Focus Point](/Rules.aspx?ID=2228). This focus point is separate from your focus pool and doesn't count toward the cap on your focus pool. You can gain this benefit only if you have a focus pool, and there might be restrictions on how the point can be used. You can't gain more than 1 Focus Point per day from focused items, no matter how many focused items you have. \n\n**[Invested](/Traits.aspx?ID=637):** A character can wear only 10 magical items that have the invested trait. None of the magical effects of the item apply if the character hasn't invested it, though the character still gains any normal benefits from wearing the physical item (like a hat keeping rain off a character's head).\n\n**[Magical](/Rules.aspx?ID=3122):** Items with this trait are imbued with magical energies. A character can craft these items only if they have the [Magical Crafting](/Feats.aspx?ID=5178) feat. Some items are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the [arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=534), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=662), or [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=676) trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicates that the item is magical.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-3148\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-3150\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-3151\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-3156\" />",

The example below shows the structure of an item stat block and gives a brief description of each entry. Entries appear only when applicable, so not all items will have every entry described here. Detailed rules governing aspects of the stat block specific to items appear after the stat block. Item Name Price This entry lists the item's Price.

Craft Requirements An item that has special requirements to be Crafted details those requirements here. Notable Item Traits The following traits apply to items. Some specific categories of item have special traits—such as elixir or scroll—described in their sections. Alchemical: Alchemical items are powered by the reactions of alchemical reagents. Alchemical items aren't magical, and they don't radiate a magical aura. Characters can Craft these items only if they have the Alchemical Crafting feat. Consumable: An item with this trait can be used only once. Unless stated otherwise, it's destroyed after activation, though part of it might be recoverable for other purposes. For instance, while a potion is consumable, the vial it comes in is not destroyed when you drink it. Consumable items include most alchemical items as well as ammunition, oils, potions, scrolls, talismans, and other magical consumables. When a character creates consumable items, they can make them in batches of four, as described in the Craft activity. Focused: An item with this trait can give you an additional Focus Point. This focus point is separate from your focus pool and doesn't count toward the cap on your focus pool. You can gain this benefit only if you have a focus pool, and there might be restrictions on how the point can be used. You can't gain more than 1 Focus Point per day from focused items, no matter how many focused items you have. Invested: A character can wear only 10 magical items that have the invested trait. None of the magical effects of the item apply if the character hasn't invested it, though the character still gains any normal benefits from wearing the physical item (like a hat keeping rain off a character's head). Magical: Items with this trait are imbued with magical energies. A character can craft these items only if they have the Magical Crafting feat. Some items are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicates that the item is magical. ",

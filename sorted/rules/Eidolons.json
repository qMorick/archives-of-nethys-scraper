An eidolon has the standard number of actions, uses a normal stat block, and counts toward the encounter's XP budget normally. Usually, an eidolon must remain within 100 feet of its summoner, or its physical form will dissolve. A summoner can make their eidolon take form or disappear with the Manifest Eidolon action, which gains a tradition trait related to the type of eidolon it manifests (examples include [arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=534) for construct eidolons; divine for angel, devil, and demon eidolons; [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=662) for phantom eidolons; and [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=676) for beast and elemental eidolons).\n\n For most eidolons, you can use standard stat blocks of appropriate types and levels. Even though they have the standard abilities, you can alter the descriptions of such creatures to make them seem more like eidolons. You might even replace one or more of their resistances or weaknesses to energy damage with different types of energy to make them more unique.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

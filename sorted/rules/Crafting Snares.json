You can spend 1 minute to [Craft](/Actions.aspx?ID=2385) a snare by expending an amount of money equal to the snare's listed Price. This expenditure represents the use of raw materials that are included in your snare toolkit. If you want to Craft a snare at a discount, you must spend downtime as described in the Craft activity. Some snares have additional requirements beyond those stated in the Craft activity; these snares list their requirements in a Craft Requirements entry.

You can make either a spell attack roll with a spellgun or a ranged attack roll using your proficiency with simple firearms. Spellguns have a range increment, which applies regardless of which type of attack roll you make. Though you can use your modifier for simple firearms, a spellgun isn't actually a firearm. You don't get the damage of a firearm Strike, nor other benefits like critical specialization. Similarly, you can't load or reload a spellgun, affix [talismans](/Equipment.aspx?Category=15&amp;Subcategory=19) to one, attach scopes, affix [attached](/Traits.aspx?ID=171) weapons like [bayonets](/Weapons.aspx?ID=186) or [reinforced stocks](/Weapons.aspx?ID=187), and so on.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

Precise senses other than sight ignore the invisible condition. You can [Seek](/Actions.aspx?ID=2301) to attempt to figure out an invisible creature's location, making it only hidden from you. This lasts until the invisible creature successfully uses [Sneak](/Actions.aspx?ID=2405) to become undetected again.

For instance, if you were tracking an invisible creature's footprints through the snow, the footprints would make it hidden.

If you have immunity to a specific condition or type of effect, you can't be affected by that condition or any effect of that type. You can still be targeted by an ability that includes an effect or condition you are immune to; you just don't apply that particular effect or condition.\n\nIf you have immunity to effects with a certain trait (such as [death effects](/Rules.aspx?ID=2331), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=669), or [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=578)), you are unaffected by effects with that trait. Often, an effect both has a trait and deals that type of damage (such as a [_lightning bolt_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1586) spell). In these cases, the immunity applies to the effect corresponding to the trait, not just the damage. However, some complex effects might have parts that affect you even if you're immune to one of the effect's traits; for instance, a spell that deals both fire and acid damage can still deal acid damage to you even if you're immune to fire.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2314\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2315\" />\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"rules-2316\" />",

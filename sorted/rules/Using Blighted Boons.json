A creature might [partake](/Rules.aspx?ID=1964) of a blighted boon without understanding the ramifications of doing so. Other beings might seek out a blighted boon for its gift, often to use the imparted might in a dire situation that merits taking the risks. Some blighted boons present their effects to potential users in visions or by other means. For such boons, no one can consume them without understanding, at least partly, what they're doing.

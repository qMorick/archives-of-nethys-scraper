For example, if a creature gains the Hellknight theme template and replaces its [leather armor](/Armor.aspx?ID=4) with [Hellknight plate](/Armor.aspx?ID=14), the Hellknight plate itself would not alter the creature's AC (although the creature would increase its AC by 1 due to the 1st Level or Higher entry). At your discretion, you can make adjustments for the new equipment, but if you do so, you might give the creature more advantages and disadvantages than the template accounts for.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

When you use a weapon or effect with the splash trait, you don’t add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. A splash weapon or effect deals any listed splash damage to the target on a failure, success, or critical success, and to all other creatures within 5 feet of the target on a success or critical success. On a critical failure, the weapon or effect misses entirely, dealing no damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target’s [resistance](/Rules.aspx?ID=2318) or [weakness](/Rules.aspx?ID=2317). You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit.\n\nFor example, if you throw a [lesser acid flask](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2875) and hit your target, that creature takes 1 acid damage, 1d6 persistent acid damage, and 1 acid splash damage. All other creatures within 5 feet of it take 1 acid splash damage. On a critical hit, the target takes 2 acid damage and 2d6 persistent acid damage, but the splash damage is still 1. If you miss, the target takes only 1 acid splash damage. If you critically fail, no one takes any damage.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

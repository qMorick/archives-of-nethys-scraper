In addition, you gain advanced alchemy, which allows you to create a certain number of infused alchemical consumables each day during your daily preparations without the normal cost or time expenditure, as described on the [Alchemist](/Classes.aspx?ID=56) page. If you gain advanced alchemy from more than one source, use the highest number of alchemical consumables per day rather than adding them together, but you can make items of any type allowed by any of your advanced alchemy abilities. For instance, [Herbalist Dedication](/Feats.aspx?ID=6339) lets you create 4 alchemical consumables with the [healing](/Traits.aspx?ID=623) trait, and [Poisoner Dedication](/Feats.aspx?ID=6382) lets you create four alchemical [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=669) consumables. If you had both feats, you could create 4 total consumables, but they could be any combination of healing and poison items. \n\n**Quick Alchemy Benefits:** You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat if you don’t already have it. In addition, you gain the [Quick Alchemy](/Actions.aspx?ID=2801) action, which lets you create short-lived alchemical consumables with a special action, and you can create a certain number of versatile vials during your daily preparations to fuel Quick Alchemy. Unless otherwise noted, you can’t regain versatile vials throughout the day the way alchemists can. The individual archetype tells you how many versatile vials you can create each day, and might impose special restrictions or benefits for how you can use them. If you gain versatile vials from more than one source, you use the highest number of vials to determine your maximum rather than adding them together, but you can use the vials for any Quick Alchemy option or other use of versatile vials you possess.\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>",

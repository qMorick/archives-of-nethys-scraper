When you use a weapon or effect with the splash trait, you don’t add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. A splash weapon or effect deals any listed splash damage to the target on a failure, success, or critical success, and to all other creatures within 5 feet of the target on a success or critical success. On a critical failure, the weapon or effect misses entirely, dealing no damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target’s [resistance](/Rules.aspx?ID=2318) or [weakness](/Rules.aspx?ID=2317). You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit.",

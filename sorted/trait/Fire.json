Fire planes are extremely hostile to non-fire creatures. Unprotected wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch fire almost immediately, and creatures wearing unprotected flammable clothing catch fire, typically taking 1d6 persistent fire damage.

Ice creatures are extremely uncomfortable on a fire plane, assuming they don’t outright melt in the heat.",

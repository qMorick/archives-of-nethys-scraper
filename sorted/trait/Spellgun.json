You can make either a spell attack roll with a spellgun or a ranged attack roll using your proficiency with simple [firearms](/WeaponGroups.aspx?ID=16). Spellguns have a range increment, which applies regardless of which type of attack roll you make. Though you can use your modifier for simple firearms, a spellgun isn't actually a firearm. You don't get the damage of a firearm Strike, nor other benefits like [critical specialization](/Rules.aspx?ID=235). Similarly, you can't load or reload a spellgun, affix [talismans](/Traits.aspx?ID=155) to one, make a spellgun Strike as part of an action that lets you make a firearm Strike, and so on.",

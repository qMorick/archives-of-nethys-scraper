This latter characteristic leads many individual amurruns into trouble, yet this inquisitiveness is paired with a penchant for good fortune that offsets much of their self-induced peril. They accept the term “catfolk” as a name for their people with grace and a hint of amusement. Ever eager to explore and learn, catfolk have spread to other parts of the world from their native nations in the southern tropics, yet never in large groups. A lone amurrun can be found anywhere in the world, but it's rare to find a settlement beyond their traditional national borders. This is due to their innate wanderlust and insatiable wonder. As many an amurrun might say, “I've lived with my people my whole life, but you? You're new and different! There's so much to learn from you!”\n\n Longstanding amurrun legends claim the catfolk were first created as guardians and were then charged with protecting the world from those sinister forces that exist at its fringes. Often, this charge manifests as a longstanding opposition to cultists of demon lords, archdevils, and other fiendish demigods. Many catfolk worship the spirits of creation, using serendipitous rituals to attract good fortune and banish ill luck in the spirits' name, while others venerate their own small pantheon of divinities. Those who travel often find comfort in the worship of [Desna](/Deities.aspx?ID=281), whose teachings closely match their own predilections.\n\n Catfolk adapt well to adventuring roles, and can be quite diverse in their areas of study and specialization. Those who follow the traditions of rangers and rogues are perhaps the most commonly encountered, but not overwhelmingly so. Their natural curiosity leads some catfolk to take up mystical arts, training as [wizards](/Classes.aspx?ID=12) or following a divine path to become [clerics](/Classes.aspx?ID=5). \r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Catfolk Name Collector](/NPCs.aspx?ID=3624) (Creature 6), [Catfolk Pouncer](/NPCs.aspx?ID=2869) (Creature 1), [Leaping Thief](/NPCs.aspx?ID=3623) (Creature 3), [Lucky Courser](/NPCs.aspx?ID=3625) (Creature 8)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_5_TreasureAndRewards.png\">Lucky Souvenirs</title>\r\n\r\nMost catfolk proudly display good luck charms from personally meaningful travels or from when they earned their name.

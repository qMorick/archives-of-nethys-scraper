The most powerful proteans are demigods known collectively as the protean lords, although they are mysterious entities whose cults in [the Universe](/Planes.aspx?ID=26) tend to be obscure and secretive.\n\n Proteans divide themselves into a loose caste system and possess a dizzying variety of powers. Most proteans have a serpentine body with the head of a primeval beast. Scholars have long been intrigued by this fact—that scions of dissolution and disorder would share so many features—pointing out that there is some semblance of order even in the purest chaos. Others note that the serpentine form is one of the most primeval shapes, perhaps suggesting that in a reality at the dawn of time, such shapes were all that could exist. The proteans themselves have little to say on the matter, which, perhaps ironically, only adds to the confusion and lack of consensus surrounding their kind. After all, if even chaos cannot be trusted to be chaotic, would that not be the purest form of entropy?  \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Warpwaves</title> Many proteans can subject their foes to warpwaves—disorienting alterations in perceived time and space—by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment. When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the specific effect on that creature. Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect lasts for 1d4 rounds, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature.\n\n##  \n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table><tr><td>**d8**</td><td>**Warpwave Effect**</td></tr><tr><td> 1</td><td>[Clumsy 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=61) (3 on a critical failure)</td></tr><tr><td> 2</td><td>[Confused](/Conditions.aspx?ID=63) and gains 4d6 temporary Hit Points</td></tr><tr><td> 3</td><td>[Dazzled](/Conditions.aspx?ID=65) (permanent on a critical failure)</td></tr><tr><td> 4</td><td>[Enfeebled 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=71) (3 on a critical failure)</td></tr><tr><td> 5</td><td>[Immobilized](/Conditions.aspx?ID=81) by filaments of energy</td></tr><tr><td> 6</td><td>[Quickened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=89) (Stride, Strike, or Step only)</td></tr><tr><td> 7</td><td>[Slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=92)</td></tr><tr><td> 8</td><td>[Stupefied 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=94) (3 on a critical failure)</td></tr></table>\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Azuretzi](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3145) (Creature 5), [Keketar](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3146) (Creature 17), [Voidworm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3144) (Creature 1)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Ancient Immortals</title>\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous types of immortals that dwell in the Great Beyond, the proteans are surely some of the oldest.

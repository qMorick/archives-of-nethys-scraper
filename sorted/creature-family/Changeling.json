Some gain the ability to see in the dark, some grow fingernails long and hard enough to serve as claws, and others gain even stranger abilities specific to their hag mother. For instance, dream mays, the children of cuckoo hags, can gain an enhanced ability to resist the magic of dreams and sleep. Other types of changelings include slag mays, the children of iron hags; callow mays, the children of sweet hags; brine mays, the children of sea hags; and others for each type of hag.\n\n As beings infused with supernatural power, changelings find themselves drawn to either the occult magic common among hags or primal magic.\n\n At roughly the same time in their lives, many changelings—women in particular—begin to hear the Call, a psychic urging from their hag mother luring them away from the communities that raised them. If followed, the Call eventually leads the changeling to the hag's coven, where they are twisted into hags themselves. Some changelings are able to resist this Call and continue on with their mortal lives. The fact that the Call disproportionately targets female changelings has led to a widespread misunderstanding that all changelings are female, while changelings of other genders are simply assumed to be members of their paternal ancestry. \r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Changeling Exile](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2877) (Creature 3)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Changeling Exiles</title>\r\n\r\nChangelings who resist the Call and abandon the society that raised them become exiles like the one presented on this page—creatures who live solitary lives in the wild and are often driven to desperate measures to survive, taking up the lifestyles of highway bandits or risk-taking wilderness guides.\r\n</aside>",

If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks.

Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. A true werecreature's natural form is its hybrid shape. In humanoid shape, the werecreature uses its original humanoid size, loses its jaws and claws Strikes, and gains a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the slashing damage dealt by its claw. In animal shape, its Speed and size change to that of the animal, it gains any special Strike effects of the animal that it didn't already have (such as [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=45)), and it loses its weapon Strikes.<br /> **Curse of the Werecreature** ([curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=566), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=676)) This curse affects only [humanoids](/Traits.aspx?ID=628); **Saving Throw** Fortitude DC is the [moderate spell DC for the werecreature's new level](/Rules.aspx?ID=2899). On each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another Fortitude save or turn into the same kind of werecreature until dawn.

The creature gains weakness to silver as shown on the table. Starting Level HP Increase Weakness to Silver 4 or lower +25 5 5–7 +35 7 8–14 +50 10 15+ +75 15 Werecreature Abilities All werecreatures gain the following abilities, some of which match an ability of the animal the werecreature transforms into. You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of the werecreature. Senses The werecreature gains all the senses of the animal. Animal Empathy The werecreature can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with animals of its general kind. Claws The werecreature gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing damage). If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage. Jaws The creature gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage) that inflicts its curse of the werecreature. If it had any non-agile attacks, the damage dealt by its jaws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only agile attacks, its jaws should deal one-third more damage. Change Shape Single Action (concentrate, polymorph, primal) The werecreature changes into its humanoid, hybrid, or animal shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. A true werecreature's natural form is its hybrid shape. In humanoid shape, the werecreature uses its original humanoid size, loses its jaws and claws Strikes, and gains a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the slashing damage dealt by its claw. In animal shape, its Speed and size change to that of the animal, it gains any special Strike effects of the animal that it didn't already have (such as Grab), and it loses its weapon Strikes. Curse of the Werecreature (curse, primal) This curse affects only humanoids; Saving Throw Fortitude DC is the moderate spell DC for the werecreature's new level. On each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another Fortitude save or turn into the same kind of werecreature until dawn. The creature is under the GM's control and goes on a rampage for half the night before falling unconscious until dawn. Moon Frenzy (polymorph, primal) When a full moon appears in the night sky, the werecreature must enter hybrid form, can't Change Shape thereafter, becomes one size larger, increases its reach by 5 feet, and increases the damage of its jaws by 2. When the moon sets or the sun rises, the werecreature returns to humanoid form and is fatigued for 2d4 hours.",

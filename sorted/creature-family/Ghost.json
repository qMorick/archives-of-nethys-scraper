Many become [unholy](/Traits.aspx?ID=521). The base creature loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=627) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=628), and any abilities or traits that rely on it being a living, corporeal creature. You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghost. All ghosts gain the following abilities.\n\n [**Darkvision**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)<br /> **Site Bound** A typical ghost can stray only a short distance from where it was killed or the place it haunts. A typical limit is 120 feet. Some ghosts are instead bound to a room, building, item, or creature that was special to it rather than a location. <br />**Rejuvenation** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579)) When a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed.

This resistance increases to 10 at 9th level and 15 at 16th level. <br />**Fly Speed** equal to its Speed<br /> **Ghostly Hand** All ghosts have a ghostly hand unarmed attack that deals void damage. It typically has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=526), [finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=602), and [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=644) traits. Some ghosts wield ghostly memories of weapons they held in life, but the effect is the same. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Special Abilities</title> Select one or two of the following abilities, or potentially three if the ghost is 9th level or higher. These should relate to the ghost's death or its history. You can also create new abilities or adapt those from monsters or classes. For DCs, use the high spell DC of the [ghost's level](/Rules.aspx?ID=2899).\n\n **Corrupting Gaze**<actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> The ghost stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target takes 1d6 void damage plus 1d6 for every 2 levels the ghost has with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Will save. A creature that fails its save is also [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=94) for 1 minute.<br /> **Draining Touch** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> With a touch, the ghost attempts to drain a living creature's life force. It makes a ghostly hand Strike but deals no damage on a hit. Instead, the target becomes [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=68) for 1 day, and the ghost regains HP equal to half its own level.<br /> **Frightful Moan** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=541), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=590), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=598), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647)) The ghost laments its fate, forcing each living creature within 30 feet to attempt a Will save. On a failure, a creature becomes [frightened 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=76) (or frightened 3 on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghost's frightful moan for 1 minute.<br /> **Inhabit Object** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> The ghost possesses an object of size Large or smaller within 20 feet, making it an [animated object](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=4). This animated object's level can be no higher than the ghost's level – 2. If the target object is being held by a creature,  the bearer can attempt a Will save to prevent the possession. This possession ends when the object is destroyed or the ghost leaves it. At this point, the ghost reappears in the object's square and can't Inhabit an Object again for 1d4 rounds.<br /> **Malevolent Possession** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> The ghost attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the [_possession_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1638) spell, except since the ghost doesn't have a physical body, it is unaffected by that restriction of the spell.<br /> **Telekinetic Assault** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579)) The ghost cries out in pain and anguish as small objects and debris fly about in a 30-foot emanation. Creatures in this area take 1d6 bludgeoning damage + 1d6 per 2 levels the ghost has, with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save.",

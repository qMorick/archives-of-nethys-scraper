Named for their distinctive habitats, these worms are ravenous and display overwhelming destructive capabilities. Cave worms of different types and abilities lurk in the more remote corners of the world—tales speak of arctic worms that dwell within immense glaciers or icebergs and grave worms that burrow through the boneyards of long-forgotten ruins, to name a few.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Benthic Worm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2872) (Creature 15), [Cave Worm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2871) (Creature 13), [Magma Worm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2873) (Creature 18)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Belly of the Beast</title>\r\n\r\nThe adventure need not end simply because the party was ingloriously swallowed whole by a giant worm. Perhaps the PCs find an undigested item that helps them survive the inhospitable environ, or maybe the worm regurgitates them in a cavern far off from where they started.

This hasn't prevented attempts to tame them or use them as guardians.

A cave worm also ingests earth and minerals as it tunnels. The worm processes some of these minerals, resulting in its armored hide and toxic sting, while it leaves others behind—often including treasure or other valuables that incidentally serve to lure explorers into the worm's proximity and, more often than not, its gullet. While not completely mindless, cave worms are difficult to train, and most attempts to domesticate them (in theory, a cave worm would make an excellent mining resource) result in disaster.\r\n</aside>",

This entity might be a covert divinity, a powerful fey, a manifestation of natural energies, an ancient spirit, or any other mighty supernatural being—but its nature is likely as much a mystery to you as it is to anyone else.

Your patron does not take well to being disturbed repeatedly, so you can cast only one spell that has the hex trait each turn; attempts to use a second automatically fail and usually cause your familiar to hiss in displeasure as your patron rejects your call.\n\n**[Spellshape](/Traits.aspx?ID=513):** Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action.

and Background</title>\r\nIn addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nIn addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.\n\n At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Patron</title>\r\nYou weren't born with the power to cast spells, nor have you spent years dedicated to worship, study, or uncovering mystical secrets. Your magic instead has been gifted to you by a potent being, one who knows that by empowering you so, you'll further the being's agenda in the world, whatever it may be. This entity is typically mysterious and distant, revealing little of their identity and motivations. They make their will known to you in abstract signs such as omens, dreams, or similar subtleties rather than words.\n\n Rather than interacting with you directly, your patron works through a familiar—a mystical creature that teaches you, serves as the conduit for your patron's magic, and maybe even keeps an eye on you to ensure you're furthering your patron's nebulous ends.\n\n At 1st level, choose your patron, which determines your spellcasting tradition and grants you the skill for that tradition of magic, your first witch's lesson and a unique familiar ability. The patron themes can be found [here](Patrons.aspx).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Witch Spellcasting</title>\r\nUsing your familiar as a conduit, your patron provides you the power to cast spells. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of your patron's tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a witch, when you cast spells, your incantations might rhyme, your gestures might be as simple as an ominous pointing finger or a complex folk sign, and your familiar might even echo your words or movements slightly as your patron's magic surges.\n\n At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells your familiar knows. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as a witch, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Witch Spells per Day table.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you get spell slots of 2nd-rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title> Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of witch spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level witch, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level witch, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Familiar</title>\r\nYour patron has sent you a [familiar](Familiars.aspx), a mystical creature that teaches you magic and facilitates your spells. This familiar follows the [familiar rules](/Rules.aspx?ID=2121), though as it's a direct conduit between you and your patron, it's more powerful than typical familiars. Your familiar gains two additional familiar abilities: one of these is a unique ability based on your patron and is always selected, and the other is an additional familiar ability that can be selected daily as normal. Your familiar gains another extra ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.\n\n **Spells**: Your familiar is the source and repository of the spells your patron has bestowed upon you, and you must commune with your familiar to prepare your spells each day using your witch spellcasting. Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-rank spells, and one additional spell determined by your patron's initial lesson. You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to.\n\n Each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells.\n\n **Learning Spells**: Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a written version of that spell over the course of 1 hour. This can be a scroll of that spell, or you can prepare a written version using the [Learn a Spell](/Actions.aspx?ID=25) exploration activity. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch's familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar's patron. You can't prepare spells from another witch's familiar.\n\n **Undying**: If your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar knew regardless. Your familiar's death doesn't affect any spells you have already prepared.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Hex Spells</title>\r\nAs a favored agent of your patron, you can invoke their power for a more direct magical intervention. A hex is a spell shaped by your patron and sent to you through your familiar, rather than an ability you use directly. Your patron expects you to advance its interests and does not take kindly to repeated requests for aid; as such, you can use only one hex each turn, and any attempts to use a second hex on that turn fail and the actions are lost.\n\n Hex spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the [Refocus](/Actions.aspx?ID=71) activity to commune with your familiar.\n\n Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear [here](/Rules.aspx?ID=2228). You learn your choice of the [_patron's puppet_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1882) hex or [_phase familiar_](/Spells.aspx?ID=804) hex, which let you command your familiar or defend it from harm, respectively. You learn most other hexes from witch lessons.\n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Hex Cantrips</title>Hex cantrips are special hexes that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still use only one hex each round. Hex cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with witch spellcasting and aren't counted toward your prepared cantrips.\n\n You gain a hex cantrip determined by your choice of [patron](Patrons.aspx).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a [skill feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=144). You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Witch Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a [witch class feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=323).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a [general feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=78).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Magical Fortitude</title>\r\nYour patron's power boosts your physical resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Expert Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou've learned to better control the power your patron has granted you. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Reflex Expertise</title>\r\nYour reflexes are lightning fast, helping you avoid danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Perception Expertise</title>\r\nYou remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nThrough sheer experience, you've improved your technique with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Defensive Robes</title>\r\nThe flow of magic through your spellcasting and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Master Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou've achieved mastery over your patron's magic. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Will of the Pupil</title>\r\nCommunion with your familiar has steeled your mental fortitude. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Legendary Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou've perfected your command of the magic your patron provides. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Patron's Gift</title>\r\nYour patron grants you the power to command incredible works of magic. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using witch spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the [Patron's Truth](/Feats.aspx?ID=1591) feat to gain a second slot.",

This entity might be a covert divinity, a powerful fey, a manifestation of natural energies, an ancient spirit, or any other mighty supernatural being—but its nature is likely as much a mystery to you as it is to anyone else. Through a special familiar, your patron grants you versatile spells and powerful hexes to use as you see fit, though you're never certain if these gifts will end up serving your patron's larger plan. Key Attribute: Intelligence At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Intelligence. Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see these key terms in many witch class features. Hex: A hex is a spell caused by your patron's direct attention and intervention. Your patron does not take well to being disturbed repeatedly, so you can cast only one spell that has the hex trait each turn; attempts to use a second automatically fail and usually cause your familiar to hiss in displeasure as your patron rejects your call. Spellshape: Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself. Roleplaying the Witch During Combat Encounters... You cast spells to change the course of battle. You use magical hexes to hamper enemies and aid allies, while leveraging more powerful spells to control the battlefield, heal, or harm, aided by your extraordinary familiar, brewed potions, and magical items. During Social Encounters... You provide knowledge on numerous topics, including a variety of magical matters, and you might call upon your patron's magic to charm or deceive others. While Exploring... You remain alert for magical traps and treasures, employing a clever array of spells to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. Your familiar might aid you through its own considerable set of exceptional abilities. In Downtime... You brew potions, craft other magical items, or hunt for new spells for your familiar to learn. You might try to learn more about your patron, their aims, or your own powers, and you might seek out the company of other witches for collaboration or community. You Might... Strive to learn more about your patron or familiar, your patron's goals, why they chose to empower you, and how you fit into their plans. Seek out new sources of magic, like scrolls and spellbooks, to supplement the spells your patron provides. View your familiar as a steadfast ally, a dear friend, or a necessary nuisance, depending on its personality. Others Probably... Wonder about the nature of your patron and the source of your magic, worrying you'll turn on them or that you unknowingly serve to a foul power. Appreciate your ability to aid them with magic, whether you do so by helping them directly or by hampering their adversaries. Take care not to offend you, fearful that you'll place a malicious hex on them if you're angered.

Ancestry and Background In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. Attribute Boosts In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class. Patron You weren't born with the power to cast spells, nor have you spent years dedicated to worship, study, or uncovering mystical secrets. Your magic instead has been gifted to you by a potent being, one who knows that by empowering you so, you'll further the being's agenda in the world, whatever it may be. This entity is typically mysterious and distant, revealing little of their identity and motivations. They make their will known to you in abstract signs such as omens, dreams, or similar subtleties rather than words. Rather than interacting with you directly, your patron works through a familiar—a mystical creature that teaches you, serves as the conduit for your patron's magic, and maybe even keeps an eye on you to ensure you're furthering your patron's nebulous ends. At 1st level, choose your patron, which determines your spellcasting tradition and grants you the skill for that tradition of magic, your first witch's lesson and a unique familiar ability. The patron themes can be found here. Witch Spellcasting Using your familiar as a conduit, your patron provides you the power to cast spells. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of your patron's tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a witch, when you cast spells, your incantations might rhyme, your gestures might be as simple as an ominous pointing finger or a complex folk sign, and your familiar might even echo your words or movements slightly as your patron's magic surges. At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells your familiar knows. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a witch, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Witch Spells per Day table. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd-rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of witch spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level witch, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level witch, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells. Familiar Your patron has sent you a familiar, a mystical creature that teaches you magic and facilitates your spells. This familiar follows the familiar rules, though as it's a direct conduit between you and your patron, it's more powerful than typical familiars. Your familiar gains two additional familiar abilities: one of these is a unique ability based on your patron and is always selected, and the other is an additional familiar ability that can be selected daily as normal. Your familiar gains another extra ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels. Spells : Your familiar is the source and repository of the spells your patron has bestowed upon you, and you must commune with your familiar to prepare your spells each day using your witch spellcasting. Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-rank spells, and one additional spell determined by your patron's initial lesson. You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to. Each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells. Learning Spells : Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a written version of that spell over the course of 1 hour. This can be a scroll of that spell, or you can prepare a written version using the Learn a Spell exploration activity. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch's familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar's patron. You can't prepare spells from another witch's familiar. Undying : If your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar knew regardless. Your familiar's death doesn't affect any spells you have already prepared. Hex Spells As a favored agent of your patron, you can invoke their power for a more direct magical intervention. A hex is a spell shaped by your patron and sent to you through your familiar, rather than an ability you use directly. Your patron expects you to advance its interests and does not take kindly to repeated requests for aid; as such, you can use only one hex each turn, and any attempts to use a second hex on that turn fail and the actions are lost. Hex spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with your familiar. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear here. You learn your choice of the patron's puppet hex or phase familiar hex, which let you command your familiar or defend it from harm, respectively. You learn most other hexes from witch lessons. Hex Cantrips Hex cantrips are special hexes that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still use only one hex each round. Hex cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with witch spellcasting and aren't counted toward your prepared cantrips. You gain a hex cantrip determined by your choice of patron. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Witch Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a witch class feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry Magical Fortitude Your patron's power boosts your physical resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Expert Spellcaster You've learned to better control the power your patron has granted you. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert. Reflex Expertise Your reflexes are lightning fast, helping you avoid danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Perception Expertise You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Weapon Expertise Through sheer experience, you've improved your technique with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert. Defensive Robes The flow of magic through your spellcasting and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert. Weapon Specialization You can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary. Master Spellcaster You've achieved mastery over your patron's magic. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to master. Will of the Pupil Communion with your familiar has steeled your mental fortitude. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Legendary Spellcaster You've perfected your command of the magic your patron provides. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary. Patron's Gift Your patron grants you the power to command incredible works of magic. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using witch spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the Patron's Truth feat to gain a second slot.",

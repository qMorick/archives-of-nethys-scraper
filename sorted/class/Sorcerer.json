>Ancestry and Background</title>\r\nIn addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nIn addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.\n\n At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Bloodline</title>\r\nChoose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent. This choice determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose them from, the additional spells you learn, and your additional trained skills. You also gain Focus Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. \n\n Bloodlines can be found [here](Bloodlines.aspx).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Sorcerer Spellcasting</title>\r\nYour bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the [Cast a Spell](/Rules.aspx?ID=2233) activity. The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline. As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the gestures and incantations you use to shape your power might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell.\n\n Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title> Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Spell Repertoire</title>\r\nThe collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your [bloodline ](Bloodlines.aspx) You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.\n\n You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see the Sorcerer Spells per Day table), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. When you gain a new rank of spells, your first new spell is always the sorcerous gift spell for that rank that's listed in your bloodline, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.\n\n Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot or vice versa. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire</title>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by [retraining](/Rules.aspx?ID=2447) during downtime.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Sorcerous Potency</title>\r\nBecause of the magical power inherent in your blood, your spells that hurt or cure are stronger than those of other spellcasters. When you Cast a Spell from your spell slots that either deals damage or restores Hit Points, you gain a status bonus to that spell's damage or healing equal to the spell's rank. This applies only to the initial damage or healing the spell deals when cast. An individual creature takes this damage or benefits from this healing only once per spell, even if the spell would damage or heal that creature multiple times.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Sorcerer Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a [sorcerer class feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=148).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Signature Spells</title>\r\nYour innate power allows you to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. \r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Magical Fortitude</title>\r\nMagical power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Expert Spellcaster</title>\r\nYour inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Reflex Expertise</title>\r\nYour reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Perception Expertise</title>\r\nYou remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou’ve improved your combat skill. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Defensive Robes</title>\r\nThe flow of magic and your defensive training combine to help you avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou’ve learned to inflict grave wounds with your most practiced weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and 4 if you’re legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Master Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Majestic Will</title>\r\nYour mind and will are tempered by your mastery of magical forces. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Bloodline Paragon</title>\r\nYou have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-rank spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don’t gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, and they can’t be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the Bloodline Perfection sorcerer feat to gain a second slot.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Legendary Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to legendary.",

Self-reflection and study allow you to refine your inherent magical skills and unlock new, more powerful abilities. The power in your blood carries a risk, however, and you constantly face the choice of whether you'll rise to become a master spellcaster or fall into destruction. Key Attribute: Charisma At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Charisma. Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following key terms in many sorcerer abilities. Blood Magic: Casting a sorcerous gift spell granted by your bloodline or a bloodline spell allows you to benefit from a blood magic effect you know. You can typically only benefit from one blood magic effect at a time, though some feats and abilities may change this. Spellshape: Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself. Roleplaying the Sorcerer During Combat Encounters... You use spells to injure your enemies, influence their minds, and hamper their movements. You might be too vulnerable to leap directly into melee combat, or your bloodline might give you abilities that help you hold your own in a brawl. While your magic is strong, you also rely on cantrips in order to conserve your more powerful spells for the right moment (or after you've used such spells up). During Social Encounters... Your natural charisma makes you good at interacting with people. While Exploring... You detect the magic around you, finding treasures and warning your party of magical traps. When your group encounters mysteries or problems related to your bloodline, you try to solve them. In Downtime... You craft magic items or scribe scrolls. Your bloodline might drive you to research your ancestry or associate with affiliated people or creatures. You Might... Have a strong independent streak, and whether you embrace or reject your magical heritage, you long to distinguish yourself both as a spellcaster and as an individual. View your lineage with fascination, fear, or something in between—anything from wholehearted acceptance to vehement rejection. Rely on magic items, such as scrolls and wands, to supplement your limited selection of spells. Others Probably... Marvel at your ability to create magic from thin air and view your abilities with equal parts admiration and mistrust. Consider you less dedicated than studious wizards, devoted clerics, and other disciplined practitioners of magic, since power comes to you naturally. Assume you're as unpredictable as the magic you bring forth, even if your personality proves otherwise.

Ancestry and Background In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. Attribute Boosts In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class. Bloodline Choose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent. This choice determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose them from, the additional spells you learn, and your additional trained skills. You also gain Focus Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. Bloodlines can be found here. Sorcerer Spellcasting Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity. The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline. As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the gestures and incantations you use to shape your power might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell. Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells. Spell Repertoire The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see the Sorcerer Spells per Day table), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. When you gain a new rank of spells, your first new spell is always the sorcerous gift spell for that rank that's listed in your bloodline, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell. Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot or vice versa. Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime. Sorcerous Potency Because of the magical power inherent in your blood, your spells that hurt or cure are stronger than those of other spellcasters. When you Cast a Spell from your spell slots that either deals damage or restores Hit Points, you gain a status bonus to that spell's damage or healing equal to the spell's rank. This applies only to the initial damage or healing the spell deals when cast. An individual creature takes this damage or benefits from this healing only once per spell, even if the spell would damage or heal that creature multiple times. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Sorcerer Feats At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a sorcerer class feat. Signature Spells Your innate power allows you to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Magical Fortitude Magical power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Expert Spellcaster Your inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert. Reflex Expertise Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Perception Expertise You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Weapon Expertise You’ve improved your combat skill. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert. Defensive Robes The flow of magic and your defensive training combine to help you avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert. Weapon Specialization You’ve learned to inflict grave wounds with your most practiced weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and 4 if you’re legendary. Master Spellcaster You have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to master. Majestic Will Your mind and will are tempered by your mastery of magical forces. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Bloodline Paragon You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-rank spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don’t gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, and they can’t be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the Bloodline Perfection sorcerer feat to gain a second slot. Legendary Spellcaster You demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to legendary.",

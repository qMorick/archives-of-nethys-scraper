Physical clues are usually the best starting point, but the GM might allow you to start an investigation from a rumor you learned or a similar clue. For instance, finding a muddy footprint is enough to ask about the creature that left it, and seeing a hasty sketch of an item or location can be enough to start your investigation of that subject. The question at the heart of your investigation should be wide-ranging and not answerable through quick observation or a single die roll. “Is this footprint made of mud?” is simple for an investigator to answer, but “Who left these footprints?” or “What location did this mud come from?” both have enough potential for an investigation.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Investigator</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYour keen insights regarding your foes make you more dangerous than your physical strength would suggest.

 "text": " Investigator Source Player Core 2 pg. 100 1.1 You seek to uncover the truth, doggedly pursuing leads to reveal the plots of devious villains, discover ancient secrets, or unravel other mysteries. Your analytical mind quickly formulates solutions to complicated problems, and your honed senses identify even the most obscure clues. Wielding knowledge as a weapon, you study the creatures and dangers you encounter to exploit their weaknesses. Key Attribute: Intelligence At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Intelligence. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. What Can I Investigate? The detail you can investigate is typically a single item, creature, or small location (such as a room or corridor), though the GM might allow a different scope for your investigation. Physical clues are usually the best starting point, but the GM might allow you to start an investigation from a rumor you learned or a similar clue. For instance, finding a muddy footprint is enough to ask about the creature that left it, and seeing a hasty sketch of an item or location can be enough to start your investigation of that subject. The question at the heart of your investigation should be wide-ranging and not answerable through quick observation or a single die roll. “Is this footprint made of mud?” is simple for an investigator to answer, but “Who left these footprints?” or “What location did this mud come from?” both have enough potential for an investigation. Roleplaying the Investigator During Combat Encounters... Your keen insights regarding your foes make you more dangerous than your physical strength would suggest. After spending a moment to study your enemies, your perceptiveness allows you to act quickly, striking them where it hurts most. You often assist tougher members of your party, wisely protecting yourself while providing vital aid. During Social Encounters... Few can stand up against your scrutiny. You might not be the most charming, but you see things for what they really are and develop an understanding of a social situation rapidly. Every conversation is an investigation, after all, and you never know what you might uncover! While Exploring... You look for clues in your environment. You often prove yourself to be a valuable ally by serving as a party scout, analyzing the intricacies of puzzles or mysterious phenomena, and pursuing leads that could reveal beneficial information. In Downtime... You study up on subjects new and old, make new allies you can share information with, and pursue hobbies that keep your active mind satisfied. You might make a bit of coin on the side working as a private detective or consulting with the local constabulary. You Might... Start asking questions—including several that are quite involved—immediately after you're presented with a conundrum. Strive to uncover the deeper meanings behind anything you encounter and to identify the social machinations that truly drive events behind the scenes. Get so involved in a case that you ignore other matters, deeming them trivial. Others Probably... Find the cascades of information you spout forth extremely helpful, if difficult to fully comprehend. Get a bit annoyed that you're such a know-it-all. Rely on you to solve mysteries, puzzles, or other challenges requiring intellectual curiosity and reasoning.

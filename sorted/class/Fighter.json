You combine your actions through clever combinations of opening moves, finishing strikes, and counterattacks whenever your foes are unwise enough to drop their guard. Whether you are a knight, mercenary, sharpshooter, or blade master, you have honed your martial skills into an art form and perform devastating critical attacks on your enemies._\r\n\r\n**Key Attribute: Strength or Dexterity** <br />\r\nAt 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity.\r\n\r\n**Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier** <br />\r\nYou increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Classes/Iconic_Valeros.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Key Terms</title>\r\n\r\nBelow are some key terms in many fighter class features.\n\n**[Flourish](/Traits.aspx?ID=606):** Actions with the flourish trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only one action with the flourish trait per round.\n\n**[Press](/Traits.aspx?ID=675):** Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. You can't use a press action when it's not your turn, even if you use the [Ready](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2792) activity.<br />Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)\n\n**[Stance](/Traits.aspx?ID=701):** A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again, whichever comes first. After you take an action with the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You can Dismiss a stance.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Fighter</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYou strike with unmatched accuracy and use specialized combat techniques.

The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Fighter Weapon Mastery</title>\r\nHours spent training with your preferred weapons, learning and developing new combat techniques, have made you particularly effective with your weapons of choice.

Key Attribute: Strength or Dexterity At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity. Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms Below are some key terms in many fighter class features. Flourish: Actions with the flourish trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only one action with the flourish trait per round. Press: Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. You can't use a press action when it's not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure.

Roleplaying the Fighter During Combat Encounters... You strike with unmatched accuracy and use specialized combat techniques. A melee fighter stands between allies and enemies, attacking foes who try to get past. A ranged fighter delivers precise shots from a distance. During Social Encounters... You can be an intimidating presence. This can be useful when negotiating with enemies, but is sometimes a liability in more genteel interactions. While Exploring... You keep up your defenses in preparation for combat, and keep an eye out for hidden threats. You also overcome physical challenges in your way, breaking down doors, lifting obstacles, climbing adeptly, and leaping across pits. In Downtime... You might perform manual labor or craft and repair armaments. If you know techniques you no longer favor, you might train yourself in new ones. If you’ve established your reputation, you might build an organization or a stronghold of your own. You Might... Know the purpose and quality of every weapon and piece of armor you own. Recognize that the danger of an adventurer’s life must be balanced out with great revelry or ambitious works. Have little patience for puzzles or problems that require detailed logic or study.

>Ancestry and Background</title>\r\nIn addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nIn addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.\n\n At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Druid Spellcasting</title>\r\nThe power of the wild world flows through you. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the primal tradition using the [Cast a Spell](/Actions.aspx?ID=72) activity (see [Casting Spells](/Rules.aspx?ID=280)). As a druid, your spellcasting incantations might be pleas to the environment around you or the invocation of ancient vows; your hands might sway like willows or curl into clawlike shapes as your gestures direct your magic.\n\n At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the [primal](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=4) spell list, or from other primal spells to which you gain access and learn via [Learn a Spell](/Actions.aspx?ID=25). Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Druid Spells per Day table.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title> Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest rank of druid spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level druid, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and a 5th-level druid's are 3rd rank.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Anathema</title>\r\nAs stewards of the natural order, druids find affronts to nature anathema. If you repeatedly perform these acts, you lose your magical abilities from the druid class, including your druid spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance with an [_atone_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=2) ritual. The following acts are anathema to all druids.\n\n **Anathema** despoil natural places, consume more natural resources than you require to live comfortably, teach the [Wildsong](/Languages.aspx?ID=116) to non-druids.\n\n Your choice of druidic order adds further anathema, as detailed in the order's entry\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Druidic Order</title>\r\nUpon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order spell (see below), and an additional trained skill tied to your order. While you'll always be a member of your initial order, it's not unheard of for a druid to request to study with other orders in search of greater understanding of the natural world, and PC druids are among the most likely to blend the powers of different orders.\n\n Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the [Refocus](/Actions.aspx?ID=71) activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order.\n\n Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear [here](/Rules.aspx?ID=276).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Shield Block</title>\r\nYou gain the [Shield Block](/Feats.aspx?ID=839) general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Voice of Nature</title>\r\nYou gain your choice of the [Animal Empathy](/Feats.aspx?ID=4709) or [Plant Empathy](/Feats.aspx?ID=4711) druid feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Wildsong</title>\r\nYou know the [Wildsong](/Languages.aspx?ID=116), a secret language known only within druid orders, in addition to any languages you know through your ancestry. The Wildsong is a melodic and tonal language sounding more like animal calls than a spoken tongue, and its alphabet involves fractals and spirals, like the arrangement of a seashell's chambers, a snowflake's crystals, or a fern's fronds. Teaching the Wildsong to non-druids is anathema.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Druid Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a [druid class feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=52).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a [skill feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=144). You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Perception Expertise</title>\r\nYou remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a [general feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=78).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Fortitude Expertise</title>\r\nAdventures have made your physique more hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Reflex Expertise</title>\r\nYou've honed your ability to dodge dangers. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Expert Spellcaster</title>\r\nYour command of primal forces has deepened, empowering your spells. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou've improved your combat skill. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Wild Willpower</title>\r\nYour primal will, like that of the greatest beast, can't be tamed. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Medium Armor Expertise</title>\r\nYou've learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou inflict great injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Master Spellcaster</title>\r\nPrimal magic answers your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Legendary Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou have developed an unparalleled rapport with the magic of nature. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Primal Hierophant</title>\r\nYou command the most potent forces of primal magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using druid spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the [Hierophant's Power](/Feats.aspx?ID=353) feat to gain a second slot.",

Ancestry and Background In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. Attribute Boosts In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class. Druid Spellcasting The power of the wild world flows through you. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the primal tradition using the Cast a Spell activity (see Casting Spells). As a druid, your spellcasting incantations might be pleas to the environment around you or the invocation of ancient vows; your hands might sway like willows or curl into clawlike shapes as your gestures direct your magic. At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list, or from other primal spells to which you gain access and learn via Learn a Spell. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Druid Spells per Day table. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest rank of druid spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level druid, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and a 5th-level druid's are 3rd rank. Anathema As stewards of the natural order, druids find affronts to nature anathema. If you repeatedly perform these acts, you lose your magical abilities from the druid class, including your druid spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance with an atone ritual. The following acts are anathema to all druids. Anathema despoil natural places, consume more natural resources than you require to live comfortably, teach the Wildsong to non-druids. Your choice of druidic order adds further anathema, as detailed in the order's entry Druidic Order Upon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order spell (see below), and an additional trained skill tied to your order. While you'll always be a member of your initial order, it's not unheard of for a druid to request to study with other orders in search of greater understanding of the natural world, and PC druids are among the most likely to blend the powers of different orders. Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear here. Shield Block You gain the Shield Block general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield. Voice of Nature You gain your choice of the Animal Empathy or Plant Empathy druid feat. Wildsong You know the Wildsong, a secret language known only within druid orders, in addition to any languages you know through your ancestry. The Wildsong is a melodic and tonal language sounding more like animal calls than a spoken tongue, and its alphabet involves fractals and spirals, like the arrangement of a seashell's chambers, a snowflake's crystals, or a fern's fronds. Teaching the Wildsong to non-druids is anathema. Druid Feats At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a druid class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Perception Expertise You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Fortitude Expertise Adventures have made your physique more hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry. Reflex Expertise You've honed your ability to dodge dangers. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Expert Spellcaster Your command of primal forces has deepened, empowering your spells. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert. Weapon Expertise You've improved your combat skill. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert. Wild Willpower Your primal will, like that of the greatest beast, can't be tamed. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Medium Armor Expertise You've learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert. Weapon Specialization You inflict great injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary. Master Spellcaster Primal magic answers your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to master. Legendary Spellcaster You have developed an unparalleled rapport with the magic of nature. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary. Primal Hierophant You command the most potent forces of primal magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using druid spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the Hierophant's Power feat to gain a second slot.",

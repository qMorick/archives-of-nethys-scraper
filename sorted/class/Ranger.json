Others say nature needs to be protected from the greedy, who wish to tame its beauty and plunder its treasures. You could champion either goal, or both. You might be a scout, tracker, or hunter of fugitives or beasts, haunting the edge of civilization or exploring the wilds. You know how to live off the land and are skilled at spotting and taking down both opportune prey and hated enemies._\r\n\r\n**Key Attribute: Strength or Dexterity** <br />\r\nAt 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity.\r\n\r\n**Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier** <br />\r\nYou increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Classes/Iconic_Harsk.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Key Terms</title>\r\n\r\nYou'll see these key terms in many ranger class features.\n\n **[Flourish](/Traits.aspx?ID=73)**: Actions with the flourish trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only one action with the flourish trait per round.\n\n**[Press](/Traits.aspx?ID=133)**: Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. You can't use a press action when it's not your turn, even if you use the [Ready](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2792) activity.<br /> Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)\n\n**Warden Spells:** Your relationship with the world around you extends from the physical to the magical. Certain feats grant you warden spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first warden spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the [Refocus](/Actions.aspx?ID=2621) activity to commune with nature.<br /> Your warden spells are primal spells. When you first gain a warden spell, you become trained in spell attacks and spell DCs. Your spellcasting attribute is Wisdom.<br /> Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear [here](/Rules.aspx?ID=2228).\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Ranger</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYou can single out particular foes to hunt, making you better at defeating them.

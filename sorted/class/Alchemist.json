You're fascinated by uncovering the secrets of science and the natural world, and you're constantly experimenting in your lab or on the go with inventive concoctions for every eventuality. You are fearless in the face of risk, hurling explosive or toxic creations at your foes. Your unique path toward greatness is lined with alchemical brews that push your mind and body to their limits._\r\n\r\n**Key Attribute: Intelligence** <br />\r\nAt 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Intelligence.\r\n\r\n**Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier** <br />\r\nYou increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Classes/Iconic_Fumbus.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Key Terms</title>\r\n\r\nYou'll see the following key terms in many alchemist class features and abilities.\n\n **[Additive](/Traits.aspx?ID=795):** Feats with the additive trait allow you to add special substances to alchemical consumables you create when you use Quick Alchemy to create a consumable (you can't use additives with quick vials). You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, you can add an additive only once per round, and most additive abilities specify a subset of alchemical consumables you can add them to.\n\n **[Coagulant](/Traits.aspx?ID=796):** Healing alchemical items with the coagulant trait lose effectiveness when many are applied in a short period of time. If a creature heals Hit Points from an item with the coagulant trait, that creature is temporarily immune to healing Hit Points from subsequent items with the coagulant trait for 10 minutes (but not immune to any other effects of those items).\n\n **[Infused](/Traits.aspx?ID=797):** An alchemical item with the infused trait has a limited time before it becomes inert. Any non-permanent effects from your infused alchemical items, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Sample Formula Book</title>\r\n\r\nYou can choose any 1st-level common alchemical items for your formula book, but the list below contains a good selection of starter formulas.

If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Alchemy</title>\r\nYou understand the reactions between all manner of reagents and can concoct alchemical items to meet your needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use specially prepared chemicals that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science.\n\n You gain the [Alchemical Crafting](/Feats.aspx?ID=5117) feat, and you can automatically identify alchemical items that you have the formula for. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Formula Book</title> An alchemist keeps meticulous formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard [formula book](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2724) for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level [alchemical items](/Equipment.aspx?Category=6) of your choice, in addition to any formulas you gained from Alchemical Crafting and your research field. \n\nEach time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to select the [Inventor](/Feats.aspx?ID=5164) skill feat so you can invent them .\n\n As normal, having the base formula is sufficient when Crafting upgraded types of the item—you don't need to learn higher-level formulas. For instance, if you have the 1st-level formula for a minor elixir of life, you can create a minor, lesser, moderate, greater, major, or true elixir of life as long as you meet the level and other prerequisites. Items with type entries that have widely varied functions require separate formulas, but most alchemical items have a structure similar to elixir of life. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Advanced Alchemy</title> During your daily preparations, you spend some time to create alchemical items that can be used over the course of the day. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, you can use an alchemist's toolkit instead of an alchemist's lab, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical raw materials requirements. You can Craft a number of alchemical items up to 4 + your Intelligence modifier. Each item must be in your formula book, have an item level equal to or lower than your level, and have the consumable trait. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Versatile Vials</title> You know how to prepare fast-acting chemicals into versatile vials, special items that can be used as bombs and be turned into other alchemical items by introducing special reagents. During your daily preparations, you can create a number of versatile vials up to 2 + your Intelligence modifier, which is also your maximum number of vials. If you're below your maximum number, you can gather reagents from the environment around you. For every 10 minutes you spend in exploration mode, you regain 2 vials; this doesn't prevent you from participating in other exploration activities.\n\n Versatile vials are infused items, and are destroyed if not used by the next time you make your daily preparations. A vial you create is always the highest type you could Craft. See the sidebar for statistics on using a versatile vial as a bomb. You can also use vials for Quick Alchemy (see below) and your research field can add to the ways you can use a vial.\n\n You can store all your versatile vials within your alchemist's toolkit, with no increase to its Bulk. Though versatile vials are physical objects, they can't be duplicated or preserved in any way. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Quick Alchemy</title> You gain the Quick Alchemy action to make the items you need on the fly.  \n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-2801\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Research Field</title>\r\nYour inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe have led you to focus on a particular field of research. At 1st level, you choose your research field. This choice gives you more formulas, a special benefit, other abilities for your versatile vials, and other benefits as you level up.\n\nResearch fields can be found [here](ResearchFields.aspx).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Alchemist Feats</title>\r\nAt 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain an [alchemist class feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=812).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Field Discovery</title>\r\nYou learn a discovery listed in your research field\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Powerful Alchemy</title>\r\nAlchemical items you infuse are particularly potent. When you create an infused alchemical item that allows a saving throw, you can change its DC to your class DC.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Alchemical Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou’ve trained to more effectively wield the weapons you find in your lab. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, alchemical bombs, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Will Expertise</title>\r\nYour mental defenses grow stronger. Your proficiency rank for will saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Alchemical Expertise</title>\r\nConstant practice has increased the effectiveness of your concoctions. Your proficiency rank for your alchemist class DC increases to expert. In addition, when you gather reagents during exploration mode, you can regain three vials instead of two.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Double Brew</title>\r\nYou know your formulas so well that you can concoct two items at once. When using the Quick Alchemy action, you can create two items. These items don’t have to be the same. If you create two consumables, you have to expend a versatile vial for each one.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Perception Expertise</title>\r\nYou remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Advanced Vials</title>\r\nYour experience helps you improve your field vials with a benefit particular to your research field.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Chemical Hardiness</title>\r\nImbibing alchemical compounds has strengthened your organs. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Greater Field Discovery</title>\r\nYou learn an incredible discovery that advances your understanding of your field, as described in your research field.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Medium Armor Expertise</title>\r\nYou’ve learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if you’re legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Alchemical Weapon Mastery</title>\r\nYou’ve mastered full capability with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, alchemical bombs, and unarmed attacks increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Explosion Dodger</title>\r\nYour experiments taught you to fling yourself out of the way of sudden explosions. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Abundant Vials</title>\r\nYou’re permanently quickened, and can use the extra action only to use Quick Alchemy to create a quick vial. You can create only one vial with this action, even if you have double brew or a similar ability.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Alchemical Mastery</title>\r\nYour concoctions are incredibly effective. Your proficiency rank for your alchemist class DC increases to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Medium Armor Mastery</title>\r\nYour skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to avoid blows. Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.",

 "text": " Alchemist Source Player Core 2 pg. 56 1.1 There's no sight more beautiful to you than a strange brew bubbling in a beaker, and you consume your ingenious elixirs with abandon. You're fascinated by uncovering the secrets of science and the natural world, and you're constantly experimenting in your lab or on the go with inventive concoctions for every eventuality. You are fearless in the face of risk, hurling explosive or toxic creations at your foes. Your unique path toward greatness is lined with alchemical brews that push your mind and body to their limits. Key Attribute: Intelligence At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Intelligence. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following key terms in many alchemist class features and abilities. Additive: Feats with the additive trait allow you to add special substances to alchemical consumables you create when you use Quick Alchemy to create a consumable (you can't use additives with quick vials). You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, you can add an additive only once per round, and most additive abilities specify a subset of alchemical consumables you can add them to. Coagulant: Healing alchemical items with the coagulant trait lose effectiveness when many are applied in a short period of time. If a creature heals Hit Points from an item with the coagulant trait, that creature is temporarily immune to healing Hit Points from subsequent items with the coagulant trait for 10 minutes (but not immune to any other effects of those items). Infused: An alchemical item with the infused trait has a limited time before it becomes inert. Any non-permanent effects from your infused alchemical items, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again. Sample Formula Book You can choose any 1st-level common alchemical items for your formula book, but the list below contains a good selection of starter formulas. A beginner's book with these formulas called The Fundamentals of Alchemy has become popular among mainstream alchemists by staying away from controversial topics like mutagens, though it has drawn criticism from fringe alchemists for guiding fledgling alchemists away from more innovative experiments. Alchemical Item Formulas : Alchemist's fire, frost vial, cheetah's elixir, elixir of life, glue bomb, smoke ball; Bomber Acid flask, bottled lightning; Chirurgeon Antidote, antiplague; Mutagenist Bestial mutagen, cognitive mutagen; Toxicologist Arsenic, giant centipede venom Roleplaying the Alchemist During Combat Encounters... You lob bombs at your foes, harry your enemies, and support the rest of your party with potent elixirs. You might even use mutagens to warp your body into a resilient and powerful weapon. During Social Encounters... You provide knowledge and experience about alchemical items and related secrets, such as poisons and diseases. While Exploring... You keep an eye out for additional ingredients that you can turn into alchemical reagents, while giving advice on all things alchemical and mysterious. In Downtime... You experiment in an alchemical lab, brewing elixirs, making bombs, and furthering your alchemical knowledge. You Might... Enjoy tinkering with strange formulas and alchemical reagents, often with a single-minded dedication and recklessness that gives others pause. Get a kick out of wreaking havoc with the alchemical concoctions you've made, and enjoy watching things burn, dissolve, freeze, and jolt. Endlessly experiment to discover new, more potent alchemical tools. Others Probably... Think you're some kind of sorcerer or an eccentric wizard and don't understand that you don't cast spells; spellcasters who clumsily dabble in alchemy only heighten this misconception. Don't understand your zeal for alchemy, creativity, and invention. Assume that if you haven't caused a catastrophe with your experimentations, you inevitably will. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way. Perception Trained in Perception Saving Throws Expert in Fortitude Expert in Reflex Trained in Will Skills Trained in Crafting Trained in a number of additional skills equal to 3 plus your Intelligence modifier Attacks Trained in simple weapons Trained in alchemical bombs Trained in unarmed attacks Defenses Trained in light armor Trained in medium armor Trained in unarmored defense Class DC Trained in alchemist class DC Class Features You gain these features as Alchemist.

Attribute Boosts In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class. Alchemy You understand the reactions between all manner of reagents and can concoct alchemical items to meet your needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use specially prepared chemicals that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science. You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat, and you can automatically identify alchemical items that you have the formula for. Formula Book An alchemist keeps meticulous formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard formula book for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to any formulas you gained from Alchemical Crafting and your research field. Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to select the Inventor skill feat so you can invent them . As normal, having the base formula is sufficient when Crafting upgraded types of the item—you don't need to learn higher-level formulas. For instance, if you have the 1st-level formula for a minor elixir of life, you can create a minor, lesser, moderate, greater, major, or true elixir of life as long as you meet the level and other prerequisites. Items with type entries that have widely varied functions require separate formulas, but most alchemical items have a structure similar to elixir of life. Advanced Alchemy During your daily preparations, you spend some time to create alchemical items that can be used over the course of the day. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, you can use an alchemist's toolkit instead of an alchemist's lab, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical raw materials requirements. You can Craft a number of alchemical items up to 4 + your Intelligence modifier. Each item must be in your formula book, have an item level equal to or lower than your level, and have the consumable trait. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first. Versatile Vials You know how to prepare fast-acting chemicals into versatile vials, special items that can be used as bombs and be turned into other alchemical items by introducing special reagents. During your daily preparations, you can create a number of versatile vials up to 2 + your Intelligence modifier, which is also your maximum number of vials.

See the sidebar for statistics on using a versatile vial as a bomb. You can also use vials for Quick Alchemy (see below) and your research field can add to the ways you can use a vial. You can store all your versatile vials within your alchemist's toolkit, with no increase to its Bulk. Though versatile vials are physical objects, they can't be duplicated or preserved in any way. Quick Alchemy You gain the Quick Alchemy action to make the items you need on the fly. Research Field Your inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe have led you to focus on a particular field of research. At 1st level, you choose your research field. This choice gives you more formulas, a special benefit, other abilities for your versatile vials, and other benefits as you level up. Research fields can be found here. Alchemist Feats At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain an alchemist class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

One of these people looks more genuine than the others and resembles someone you're likely to meet for the first time in the next 24 hours (if anyone). This resemblance might be metaphorical, such a clown signifying someone who is silly or a stilt-walker representing someone who is tall. You also get a sense for whether this person can be trusted, should be distrusted, or neither, based on how they're most likely to interact with you and your allies. The GM decides who this new person might be, then rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the result is always “neither,” making it hard to determine whether a “neither” result is accurate.",

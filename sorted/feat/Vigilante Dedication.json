If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they must use a [Seek](/Actions.aspx?ID=2301) action to attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC, as if you were using the [Impersonate](/Actions.aspx?ID=2388) action. Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC.

Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity may risk exposing you as a vigilante.

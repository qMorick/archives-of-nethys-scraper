You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat, the [advanced alchemy benefits](/Rules.aspx?ID=3282), and the [Quick Alchemy benefits](/Rules.aspx?ID=3282), creating up to 4 versatile vials during your daily preparations. You can replenish these vials during exploration just like an alchemist can. You can use your versatile vials to make fireworks, Launch a Fireworks Display, and use other feats from this archetype (see below). You can also create a special item called a fireworks display using your daily alchemical consumables from your advanced alchemy benefits. These displays are designed to create distinctive effects you can use to make onlookers marvel and even to gain an advantage in combat. You gain the Launch Fireworks action and learn some basic effects. You can learn additional, more complex displays that use your daily fireworks display resources through other firework technician feats.

You can freely move about, though you can't touch or move anything, cast spells, attack, or otherwise affect anything around you. Despite your ghostly form, you are not [incorporeal](/Traits.aspx?ID=222) and can't pass through barriers you couldn't in your body. Most effects can't harm your spirit form, though some spells, like [_spirit blast_](/Spells.aspx?ID=301) and [_spirit song_](/Spells.aspx?ID=303), explicitly damage a creature's spirit. You can return to your body as a free action. If you are in spirit form at the beginning of your turn, you must attempt another backlash check for your deviation, returning to your body if you fail.",

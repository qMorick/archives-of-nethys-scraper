Use your [Fireworks Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8) modifier as your counteract modifier, and your counteract level is equal to half your level (rounded up). A coughing dragon costs 2 batches of infused reagents rather than 1, but you can increase the cost to 3 batches and spend an additional action to create an even bigger coughing dragon display that attempts to counteract both auditory and visual effects at the same time.",

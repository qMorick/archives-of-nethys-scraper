The next three attacks made with the crossbow deal 1d6 damage of the bomb’s damage type in addition to the crossbow’s normal damage. If the second and third attacks are not all made within 1 minute of the first attack, the bomb’s energy is wasted. These attacks never deal splash damage or other special effects of the bomb and are not modified by any abilities that add to or modify a bomb’s effect. The addition of the bracket serves to unbalance the weapon, reducing its range to 30 feet. It otherwise functions as a crossbow (when determining damage, reload, and so on). Creatures use their crossbow proficiency when using the alchemical crossbow.

Reload 1 Type Ranged Category Simple Group Bow --- This crossbow can deliver alchemically infused bolts. The strange weapon has a metal bracket mounted on the side of the stock near the lath. As an action, you can load a single lesser alchemical bomb into the bracket; this bomb must be one that deals energy damage (such as an acid flask, alchemist’s fire, bottled lightning, frost vial, or thunderstone). The next three attacks made with the crossbow deal 1d6 damage of the bomb’s damage type in addition to the crossbow’s normal damage. If the second and third attacks are not all made within 1 minute of the first attack, the bomb’s energy is wasted. These attacks never deal splash damage or other special effects of the bomb and are not modified by any abilities that add to or modify a bomb’s effect. The addition of the bracket serves to unbalance the weapon, reducing its range to 30 feet. It otherwise functions as a crossbow (when determining damage, reload, and so on). Creatures use their crossbow proficiency when using the alchemical crossbow. The alchemical crossbow costs 25 gp. Critical Specialization Effects Source Core Rulebook pg. 283 4.0 Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success.

When a lure is attached to a combat fishing pole, it can be used to make thrown weapon attacks with a range increment of 20 feet, though the lure must then be reeled back in with an [Interact](/Actions.aspx?ID=2297) action before the weapon can be used at range again (see the tethered trait). The ranged trip, tethered, thrown, and versatile P traits of the combat fishing pole only apply to thrown attacks made with a lure; throwing the pole itself leaves you with no practical way to retrieve it other than moving to its location and picking it up. A combat fishing pole can be used alongside fishing tackle to fish, and it adds its item bonus from weapon potency runes (if any) as an item bonus on checks to fish when used in this manner.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Critical Specialization Effects</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Core Rulebook](/Sources.aspx?ID=1) pg. 283 <sup>4.0</sup>\r\n\r\nCertain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success.

When a lure is attached to a combat fishing pole, it can be used to make thrown weapon attacks with a range increment of 20 feet, though the lure must then be reeled back in with an Interact action before the weapon can be used at range again (see the tethered trait). The ranged trip, tethered, thrown, and versatile P traits of the combat fishing pole only apply to thrown attacks made with a lure; throwing the pole itself leaves you with no practical way to retrieve it other than moving to its location and picking it up. A combat fishing pole can be used alongside fishing tackle to fish, and it adds its item bonus from weapon potency runes (if any) as an item bonus on checks to fish when used in this manner.

Uzunjati understand that knowledge lives in stories passed down through the generations and also is earned every day through personal experience. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1103\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1104\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1105\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1106\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1107\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1108\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1109\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1110\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1111\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1112\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1113\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-1114\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-2166\" />","trait":["Uncommon"],"trait_group":["Rarity"],"trait_markdown":"[Uncommon](/Traits.aspx?ID=159)","trait_raw":["Uncommon"],"type":"Archetype","url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=29","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"archetype-30","_score":4.88543,"_source":{"access":"A character who is Magaambyan of at least attendant rank has access to this option.","archetype":["Halcyon Speaker"],"archetype_category":["Faction","Mystical"],"category":"archetype","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"archetype-30","level":6,"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Archetype 6\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Halcyon Speaker](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=30)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\n\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n</traits>\n\n**Source** [Character Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=12) pg. 104 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\nOne of Old-Mage Jatembe’s central lessons was that magic was magic, no matter what the source.

Halcyon spells are spells from the [arcane](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1) or [primal](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=4) spell list. You don’t gain new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead, you gain new halcyon spells and new spell levels of halcyon spells only through feats. Halcyon spells are prepared or cast just like other spells granted by your class; for example, a [wizard](/Classes.aspx?ID=12) who gained halcyon spells would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a [sorcerer](/Classes.aspx?ID=11) would add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire. If you have more than one arcane or primal spellcasting class, you add halcyon spells to all such classes.\n\n Each time you cast a halcyon spell, decide whether it is an arcane or primal spell. You can’t heighten a halcyon spell beyond your maximum spell level of halcyon spell, even if you have higher-level spell slots, and you can’t select a halcyon spell as a signature spell.\n\n Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, and each time you gain a halcyon feat, you can swap out one of your old halcyon spells for a different halcyon spell of the same level; this is in addition to any swapping from your class, such as via a sorcerer’s spell repertoire class feature. You can also swap out halcyon spells by retraining during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out a halcyon spell, you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Magaambyan Archetypes</title>\r\n\r\nThese archetypes are uncommon, but characters who are Magaambyans of at least attendant rank have access to them.

For example, if you have the panache class feature and your Acrobatics check for a Boarding Assault exceeds the very hard DC for your level, you would gain panache.

Multiclass Summoner Characters The summoner archetype grants you an eidolon to join you in battle. It's a particularly helpful multiclass for characters with weaker martial abilities. Alchemist summoners can use their eidolons as lab assistants or even as the source of experiments. They are a good fit for construct or plant eidolons. Barbarian summoners find themselves drawn to the fury of anger phantoms, the two fueled by the same inner instinct. Bard summoners inspire their eidolons to greater heights with their bardic performances. They often team up with eidolons who pair well with their muse, such as a fey eidolon for a polymath muse or a phantom eidolon for a warrior muse. Champion summoners get along best with divine eidolons matching the alignment associated with their cause—angel eidolons for the tenets of good, devil eidolons for a tyrant, and so on. This allows the champion and eidolon to have a unity in philosophy and purpose that other eidolon choices might lack. Cleric summoners often find a connection to eidolons associated with their deity, such as a Sarenite cleric who chooses an angel eidolon. Clerics' ability to heal and support allows them to keep their eidolon healthy. Druid summoners find the life link with primal eidolons to be a religious experience. They are especially likely to bond with eidolons that match their order, such as plant eidolons for the leaf order or beast eidolons for the animal or wild order. Fighter summoners use tactics and techniques with their eidolons to best foes. They can partner with eidolons of any kind, but they work especially well with eidolons who provide utilities that complement their fighting style. Monk summoners often choose eidolons that are on their own path to enlightenment, to help enrich the monk's journey. These might be divine eidolons, especially if the monk is religious or uses divine ki spells, but they also might be phantoms seeking to transcend their phantom existence to reach the afterlife. Ranger summoners get along best with beast and plant eidolons, but they make a good team with other eidolons as well, especially when an archer ranger teams up with a melee eidolon. Rogue summoners gain a partner in crime that can disappear when necessary, providing the eidolon with the ultimate getaway as long as no one expects it to carry back loot from a heist. Rogues work well with tricky eidolons, such as fey, and they get a lot of mileage out of sharing their skills with their eidolon. The Unfetter Eidolon feat can be especially useful if the rogue wants to establish a quick alibi far from the eidolon's crimes. Sorcerer summoners often choose eidolons that match closely to their bloodline, such as a psychopomp eidolon for the psychopomp bloodline. The eidolon might even be part of the story of how the sorcerer gained their bloodline.

Others, notably [sorcerer](/Classes.aspx?ID=11) and [wizard](/Classes.aspx?ID=12) elementalists, feel a stronger connection to a singular element that they hone to great heights, utilizing the other three elements to support and augment their favored element.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Elemental Magic (1st)</title>\r\n\r\nYou're a spellcaster that's specialized in harnessing the four elements. Though you might feel a stronger kinship for one element over the others, you're capable of shaping all of them. Due to your specialization in elemental magic, you have a smaller, more focused spell list than other spellcasters, though your magic is drawn from multiple traditions. If you choose this class archetype, you must select the Elementalist Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.\n\n **Prerequisites**: You must have a spellcasting class feature that chooses spells from the [arcane](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1) or [primal](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=4) spell list.\n\n **Elementalist Adjustments**: Replace your spell list with the [elemental spell list](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=5). Your actual magical tradition is unchanged, but you choose your spells from the elemental list instead.\n\n If you're a sorcerer with the [elemental bloodline](/Bloodlines.aspx?ID=6), you can replace your initial bloodline spell with an initial elemental focus spell, and your advanced bloodline spell with an advanced elemental focus spell. The initial and advanced elemental focus spells you select must have the same trait as your elemental bloodline and come from the options listed below.\n\n **Druid Elementalist Adjustments**: If you're a druid of the [storm order](/DruidicOrders.aspx?ID=3), you can choose to replace your starting order spell, [_tempest surge_](/Spells.aspx?ID=479), with [_updraft_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1058).\n\n **Wizard Elementalist Adjustments**: If you're a wizard with an arcane school, instead of specializing in a school of magic, you specialize in one of the four elements: air, earth, fire, or water. Any benefits your arcane school would grant you that are associated with a selected spell school, you instead apply to your selected element. For example, if you select air as your element, you can prepare only spells that have the [air](/Traits.aspx?ID=5) trait in your extra arcane school slots, you can prepare an extra air cantrip, and you add an extra air spell from the elemental spell list to your spellbook. Additionally, in place of your arcane school spell, you learn the initial elemental focus spell of your selected element. In all other ways, your arcane school functions as written in the _Core Rulebook_.

You believe that by balancing, mixing, and rearranging these four elements, magic is made. This belief has led you to eschew traditional magical theories and divisions, and you instead focus on harnessing, manipulating, and shaping the four elements. You cast spells drawn from multiple traditions and can use the four elements to alter and empower your spells, making them manifest and mixing them in unique ways. Most elementalists embrace the four elements equally as a mystical quaternity, and they strengthen their connection to one of these elements each day to protect themselves from harm.

Flexible Spell Preparation (1st) This class feature alters your spellcasting class feature (such as Arcane Spellcasting for the wizard or Divine Spellcasting for the cleric). If you choose this class archetype, you must select Flexible Spellcaster Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat. Prerequisites : You must have a class, such as clerics, druids, witches, and wizards, that prepares spells in spell slots using the same number of prepared spells per day. Flexible Spellcaster Adjustments : You learn spells as normal for your class (a wizard uses a spellbook, a witch teaches spells to their familiar, and so on), but change your spellcasting from your class as follows. You can cast fewer spells each day. Your number of spell slots per day don't advance from 2 to 3 spells at even levels (see Table 5—1). Reduce the number of cantrips you gain from your class by 2. This archetype doesn't change the way you prepare cantrips. During your daily preparations, you prepare a spell collection rather than preparing spells into each spell slot individually. The number of spells in your spell collection each day equals the total number of spell slots you get each day from your class spells. Select these spells from the same source as normal, such as from a spellbook for a wizard. You can cast any of the spells in your collection by using a spell slot of an appropriate level. For instance, if you were level 1 and had feather fall and magic missile in your spell collection, you could cast feather fall twice that day, magic missile twice, or each spell once. Extra spell slots you gain that have additional restrictions, like the wizard's specialist school spells or the cleric's divine font spells, don't change due to this archetype, nor do such spells count toward the number of spells you place in your spell collection.

If so, flexible spellcaster doesn't change the way that spell works. Heightening Spells Once you gain 2nd-level spells, you can heighten any spell in your spell collection to any level you can cast, similar to a spontaneous spellcaster's signature spells. The only restriction is that you must select at least one 1st-level spell for your collection each time you prepare, ensuring that you can use all your spell slots each day. Adjudicating Class Feats And Features Some of your class feats or features might rely on the fact that you prepare spells in spell slots. While some class feats might no longer work or be necessary with the flexible spellcaster archetype, in many cases you can make a simple replacement and continue using the class feat. The following class feats simply require replacing “a spell you have prepared” or “a prepared spell” for “a spell in your collection” or “a spell slot.” For example, in Counterspell, you'd replace “a spell you have prepared” in the trigger for “a spell in your collection” and “expend a prepared spell” for “expend a spell slot.” Similarly, in arcane bond, you'd replace “cast one spell you prepared today and already cast” with “cast one spell in your collection you've already cast today.” The Counterspell and Leyline Conduit feats in the Core Rulebook need these substitutions, as does Form Retention from the Advanced Player's Guide . Spell Mastery provides additional restricted spells, like divine font or specialist spells; you can take it, but it doesn't add to your collection and works like normal prepared spells. Disallowed Feats The following feats from the Core Rulebook aren't available for a flexible spellcaster: Call of the Wild, Clever Counterspell, Infinite Possibilities, Reprepare Spell, and Spell Combination.

You must select Wellspring Mage Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.\n\n **Prerequisites**: You must have a class that casts spells with a spell repertoire.\n\n **Wellspring Mage Adjustments**: You learn spells as normal for your class, but change your spontaneous spellcasting in the following ways.\n\n You can cast fewer spells each day unless you gain more spells thanks to your wellspring. Reduce your number of spell slots of each spell level by 1. Reduce the number of cantrips you gain from your class by 1.\n\n A wellspring of magic fills you with power that's not fully under your control. When you roll initiative for a non-trivial combat encounter, as well as in other high-stress situations of the GM's choice, magic wells up within you. Attempt a DC 6 flat check. \n\n **Critical Success** You temporarily recover an expended spell slot of any level of your choice. The temporary spell slot lasts for 1 minute, and if you don't use it by then, you experience an immediate wellspring surge. <br />**Success** As critical success, except you randomly determine the level of spell slot from among your top three spell levels (or all your levels of spell slots if you have fewer than three). The slot lasts 3 rounds instead of 1 minute. <br />**Failure** You generate a wellspring surge, with a spell level chosen randomly among your top three levels of spell slots (or all your levels if you have fewer than three). \n\nYou can gain a temporary spell slot no more than twice per day. If you would gain a temporary spell slot for a level that has no expended spell slots, there's no effect. If you use a temporary slot to cast a spell with a duration, the spell ends whenever you would have lost the slot if its duration hasn't yet elapsed. If you roll for wellspring magic while you currently have a temporary spell slot, you automatically fail the flat check.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Wellspring Surges</title>\r\n\r\nWhen your wellspring magic goes out of control, it becomes a wellspring surge. Typically, this happens when you fail the flat check from wellspring magic, but other wellspring mage feats have effects that sometimes cause you to generate a wellspring surge, or might even cause your foes to do so.\n\n Roll 1d20 and use Table 5–2: Wellspring Surges below to determine the surge's effect. If the effect calls for a damage type, the GM chooses the type based on the types of spells you know or your current location. The wellspring surge uses your spell DC. You have no control over the way your wellspring surge manifests. You are the point of origin for your wellspring surges, and you are not excluded from their effects. If you force a foe to generate a surge, they are the origin point of that surge instead.\n\n If your wellspring was granted by a being like a god or muse, the entity's intentions might sometimes alter the results of wellspring surges, or move the point of origin for an area to any point within 30 feet if the GM determines this fits the situation. For example, instead of uncontrolled damage, the entity might choose to damage only creatures opposing its plan, even if they are your allies.\n\n A wellspring surge always has the trait of your magical tradition, plus any traits that appear in parentheses at the end of the surge's effects.\n\n## Table 5-2: Wellspring Surges\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**d20**</td><td>**Effect**</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>**Energy Unleashed** ([evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65)) Raw energy deals 2d6 damage per spell level of the surge ([basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save) in a 10-foot burst.</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>**Positive Energy Expulsion** ([healing](/Traits.aspx?ID=89), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128)) Positive energy explodes outward, healing living creatures for 1d8 Hit Points per spell level of the surge in a 20-foot burst.

The GM determines the specific creature. The creature is [unfriendly](/Conditions.aspx?ID=40) to you and [friendly](/Conditions.aspx?ID=18) to your apparent enemies.

You must attempt a Will saving throw. You take 1d4 mental damage per spell level with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Will save.

The [Escape](/Actions.aspx?ID=79) DC is equal to the spell DC.</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>**Tinge of Terror** ([emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) All creatures within 20 feet are affected by powerful fright.

This grants you a +2 status bonus to [Diplomacy](/Skills.aspx?ID=6), [Intimidation](/Skills.aspx?ID=7), and [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) checks, a –2 status penalty to [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) checks, and makes certain uses of [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15) virtually impossible. It might have other effects as the GM sees fit.</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>**Life Sap** ([necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) The surge drains your life force and strength. You become [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) and [doomed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=9), and you are [enfeebled 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=13) for 1 minute.</td></tr> <tr><td>16</td><td>**Ablative Barrier** ([abjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=2)) Energy forms a protective barrier that ablates slowly as creatures in the area take damage. All creatures in a 40-foot burst gain resistance to all damage equal to double the surge's spell level for up to 1 minute.

Wellspring Magic (1st) You regain magic power quickly, but it can be difficult for you to control. You must select Wellspring Mage Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat. Prerequisites : You must have a class that casts spells with a spell repertoire. Wellspring Mage Adjustments : You learn spells as normal for your class, but change your spontaneous spellcasting in the following ways. You can cast fewer spells each day unless you gain more spells thanks to your wellspring. Reduce your number of spell slots of each spell level by 1. Reduce the number of cantrips you gain from your class by 1. A wellspring of magic fills you with power that's not fully under your control. When you roll initiative for a non-trivial combat encounter, as well as in other high-stress situations of the GM's choice, magic wells up within you. Attempt a DC 6 flat check. Critical Success You temporarily recover an expended spell slot of any level of your choice. The temporary spell slot lasts for 1 minute, and if you don't use it by then, you experience an immediate wellspring surge. Success As critical success, except you randomly determine the level of spell slot from among your top three spell levels (or all your levels of spell slots if you have fewer than three). The slot lasts 3 rounds instead of 1 minute. Failure You generate a wellspring surge, with a spell level chosen randomly among your top three levels of spell slots (or all your levels if you have fewer than three). You can gain a temporary spell slot no more than twice per day. If you would gain a temporary spell slot for a level that has no expended spell slots, there's no effect. If you use a temporary slot to cast a spell with a duration, the spell ends whenever you would have lost the slot if its duration hasn't yet elapsed. If you roll for wellspring magic while you currently have a temporary spell slot, you automatically fail the flat check. Wellspring Surges When your wellspring magic goes out of control, it becomes a wellspring surge. Typically, this happens when you fail the flat check from wellspring magic, but other wellspring mage feats have effects that sometimes cause you to generate a wellspring surge, or might even cause your foes to do so. Roll 1d20 and use Table 5–2: Wellspring Surges below to determine the surge's effect. If the effect calls for a damage type, the GM chooses the type based on the types of spells you know or your current location. The wellspring surge uses your spell DC. You have no control over the way your wellspring surge manifests. You are the point of origin for your wellspring surges, and you are not excluded from their effects. If you force a foe to generate a surge, they are the origin point of that surge instead. If your wellspring was granted by a being like a god or muse, the entity's intentions might sometimes alter the results of wellspring surges, or move the point of origin for an area to any point within 30 feet if the GM determines this fits the situation. For example, instead of uncontrolled damage, the entity might choose to damage only creatures opposing its plan, even if they are your allies. A wellspring surge always has the trait of your magical tradition, plus any traits that appear in parentheses at the end of the surge's effects. ## Table 5-2: Wellspring Surges d20 Effect 1 Energy Unleashed (evocation) Raw energy deals 2d6 damage per spell level of the surge (basic Reflex save) in a 10-foot burst. 2 Positive Energy Expulsion (healing, necromancy, positive) Positive energy explodes outward, healing living creatures for 1d8 Hit Points per spell level of the surge in a 20-foot burst. Undead creatures instead take the same amount of positive damage, with a basic Will save. 3 Mass Siphon (transmutation) Creatures and objects within a 30-foot emanation become nearly weightless until the end of your next turn. Nearly weightless creatures can Climb at their land Speed and can Leap as far upward as they could normally Leap horizontally. 4 Magical Nemesis (conjuration, teleportation) A random creature connected to your magic (or inimical to it) appears within 60 feet. The creature should be of a level approximately equal to the level of an animal summoned by summon animal of the spell level, although it can be of any type. The GM determines the specific creature. The creature is unfriendly to you and friendly to your apparent enemies. After 1 minute, the creature can choose either to return where it came from or to remain. It is not summoned or a minion. 5 Monstrous Transformation (mental, morph, transmutation) Your head and arms transform into an exaggerated imitation of a creature connected to your magic for 1 minute. The GM determines the creature. You gain a status bonus to weapon and unarmed damage rolls equal to the spell level. At the start of each of your turns while you are transformed, you must succeed at a Will saving throw or be confused until the start of your next turn. On a critical success, you can choose to end the effect entirely, also losing the status bonus. 6 Sudden Gale (air, evocation) Weather in a 40-foot emanation is disturbed. Strong winds blow in a random direction for 1 minute. Each creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or fall prone (and be pushed 10 feet on a critical failure), and you must succeed at this save immediately after the surge. Any movement against the wind is difficult terrain, or greater difficult terrain while flying. 7 Tremor (earth, evocation) The earth trembles in a 40-foot emanation. Each creature on a surface must immediately succeed at a Fortitude save or fall prone. The surface then becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. 8 Oppressive Voice (divination, mental, nonlethal) The voice of your muse, your deity, an ancestor, or another appropriate entity suddenly overwhelms your mind. You must attempt a Will saving throw. You take 1d4 mental damage per spell level with a basic Will save. On a failure, you're also stunned 1 (stunned 2 on a critical failure). 9 Trinket Squall (illusion) Visual illusions of objects related to your magic fall like rain throughout a 40-foot burst for 1 minute, giving concealment in the area. Creatures can attempt to disbelieve this illusion. 10 Antimagic Eruption (abjuration) The surge attempts to counteract a random spell active on you and on each creature within a 10-foot burst. 11 Mental Broadcast (detection, divination, mental) For 1 minute, everyone within 30 feet of you can hear your surface thoughts. 12 Verdant Clutch (conjuration, plant) Plants and vines grow from all surfaces within 20 feet, causing all creatures in the area to be immobilized unless they succeed at a Reflex save. The Escape DC is equal to the spell DC. 13 Tinge of Terror (emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) All creatures within 20 feet are affected by powerful fright. They attempt a Will save, becoming frightened 1 on a failure or frightened 2 on a critical failure. 14 Strike up the Band (auditory, illusion) For 1 minute, you are followed by orchestral theme music tied to the emotional content of the actions you're performing. This grants you a +2 status bonus to Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance checks, a –2 status penalty to Deception checks, and makes certain uses of Stealth virtually impossible. It might have other effects as the GM sees fit. 15 Life Sap (necromancy) The surge drains your life force and strength. You become drained 1 and doomed 1, and you are enfeebled 2 for 1 minute. 16 Ablative Barrier (abjuration) Energy forms a protective barrier that ablates slowly as creatures in the area take damage. All creatures in a 40-foot burst gain resistance to all damage equal to double the surge's spell level for up to 1 minute. Whenever a creature applies this resistance, the resistance for all affected creatures reduces by 1. The effect ends for all creatures when it reduces to 0. 17 Luminous Pests (illusion, visual) Numerous tiny flying creatures formed of bright colorful light, such as bats or hummingbirds, emerge from you, flying in a 30-foot cone. You and all creatures in the cone must succeed at a Will save or be dazzled for 1 minute, or blinded for 1 round and then dazzled for 1 minute on a critical failure. 18 Emotional Turmoil (emotion, enchantment, mental) A swirl of conflicting emotions overwhelm you from the surging magic. For 1 minute, attempt a DC 11 flat check at the start of each of your turns. On a success, you gain a +2 status bonus to all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks; on a failure, you take a –2 status penalty to them instead. 19 Sudden Downpour (evocation, water) Water cascades from above, putting out non-magical fires in a 10-foot burst and attempting to counteract magical fires. 20 Spell Surge You immediately cast any spell in your repertoire of the surge's spell level or lower (or from your prepared spells or innate spells if you don't have a repertoire but have been forced to generate a wellspring surge). You must choose a spell that takes 3 or fewer actions to cast. Click here for more rules on using this archetype.

It doesn't matter if it's as common as a chariot or as complex as an airship, there's always some aspect of the vehicle you can improve upon. Pilots, drivers, and sailors alike value your expertise, and many seek you out to work on their vehicles. While you can make a great profit working on custom vehicles for wealthy clients, you still keep a vehicle of your own to tinker with as your personal passion project.\n\n You might be part of a vehicle mechanic union, working with other mechanics and engineers to find fair jobs and support each other's labor. While some vehicle mechanic unions are secular, many realize the benefits of organizing alongside a sympathetic religion, and so they typically adopt the ideals of economically-focused gods like [Abadar](/Deities.aspx?ID=1) or deities interested in crafting such as the goddess [Brigh](/Deities.aspx?ID=33)—the Whisper in Bronze—the goddess of invention. Whether religious or secular, vehicle mechanic unions take the bonds between fellow union members seriously. While this might mean your character becomes obligated to help a fellow union member who needs your help, it also means you have steadfast allies you can fall back on in your own time of need. In dire straits, such a connection can be worth its weight in gold.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Unions</title>\r\n\r\nVehicle mechanics typically ply their trade to those who need to keep their vehicles finely tuned. As in most other such trades, some vehicle mechanics form unions to keep business practices fair and to protect each other from predatory employers. The Absalom Shipwright's Union is the largest union for vehicle mechanics in Absalom, with over a thousand builders, carpenters, and engineers among its membership. **Almenia Oarstone** (LG female dwarf shipwright) is the current leader of the union, having been a member for more than 60 years.

It doesn't matter if it's as common as a chariot or as complex as an airship, there's always some aspect of the vehicle you can improve upon. Pilots, drivers, and sailors alike value your expertise, and many seek you out to work on their vehicles. While you can make a great profit working on custom vehicles for wealthy clients, you still keep a vehicle of your own to tinker with as your personal passion project. You might be part of a vehicle mechanic union, working with other mechanics and engineers to find fair jobs and support each other's labor. While some vehicle mechanic unions are secular, many realize the benefits of organizing alongside a sympathetic religion, and so they typically adopt the ideals of economically-focused gods like Abadar or deities interested in crafting such as the goddess Brigh—the Whisper in Bronze—the goddess of invention. Whether religious or secular, vehicle mechanic unions take the bonds between fellow union members seriously. While this might mean your character becomes obligated to help a fellow union member who needs your help, it also means you have steadfast allies you can fall back on in your own time of need. In dire straits, such a connection can be worth its weight in gold. Unions Vehicle mechanics typically ply their trade to those who need to keep their vehicles finely tuned. As in most other such trades, some vehicle mechanics form unions to keep business practices fair and to protect each other from predatory employers. The Absalom Shipwright's Union is the largest union for vehicle mechanics in Absalom, with over a thousand builders, carpenters, and engineers among its membership. Almenia Oarstone (LG female dwarf shipwright) is the current leader of the union, having been a member for more than 60 years. It is said that you can count on one hand the number of ships that have docked in Absalom on which she has never worked. The Shipwright's Union manages shipbuilding and repairs in both the Devil's Own and the Sea King Shipyard, and sometimes dispatches members to handle jobs that need doing at the Docks.

This means that beast guns predate all other forms of firearm crafting in Arcadia, even the legendary star guns, whose secrets have been lost to the ages. The tradition of designing beast guns has persisted throughout Arcadia well into the modern era, though it has become increasingly rare as the proliferation of classic firearms and the prestige associated with star guns has allowed more people access to equivalent destructive power without the intense requirements behind crafting a beast gun. However, beast gunners remain virtually unknown outside of Arcadia.\n\n The art of bonding to a beast gun and gaining the full magic of a beast gunner is an extended ritual with multiple steps, beginning with the hunt. A person seeking to bond to a beast gun typically does so with a brand new weapon made after they hunt down the creature themselves. This involves telling the story of the hunt, the beast, and the weapon created from the hunted creature. Finally, the weapon is carefully modified and tailored to ensure a proper bond between the beast gun and the prospective beast gunner. However, it's also possible to bond to an heirloom beast gun passed down through the generations by adding symbolic fresh components from the same kind of creature, after performing the same ritual hunt necessary to forge a new weapon with the intent of establishing a bond.\n\n To perform the ritual the prospective beast gunner must first plan a hunt to slay the creature corresponding to the beast gun, whether they wish to bond with a brand new beast gun or establish a link to an old beast gun. Typically, these ritualized hunts can include up to five assistants plus hunting beasts like canines or birds who help corner the beast and bring it down. If the assistants are significantly more powerful than the hunted creature, or if there are so many assistants the creature never stood a chance at survival, the magic simply fails during the bonding process and the hunt and organic materials are wasted, usually much to the shame and chagrin of the hunter. The same doesn't apply if the prospective beast gunner hunts the creature alone, even if they are significantly more powerful than the creature, such that the creature never stood a chance against them in a one on one fight.\n\n You're one of those who successfully completed the hunt and bonded with your prized weapon. Now, you seek to discover the hidden depths that others who think they know how to use beast guns can only imagine.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Choosing Your Beast Gun</title>\r\n\r\nA beast gunner's bond with their beast gun is deep and mystical, so if you hope to be a successful beast gunner, it's important to choose a beast gun that suits your temperament, magic, and combat style. For example, if you favor strength and intimidation, a [_screech shooter_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=1169) is the right choice for you, whereas a [_spider gun_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=1170) might be optimal if you prefer a more careful style of setting up the battlefield in advance. Similarly, a [_tentacle cannon_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=1172) is slow and methodical and can hold an enemy in place at close range, while a [_drake rifle_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=1166) is energetic and mobile and can be used to attack from a great distance.

If the assistants are significantly more powerful than the hunted creature, or if there are so many assistants the creature never stood a chance at survival, the magic simply fails during the bonding process and the hunt and organic materials are wasted, usually much to the shame and chagrin of the hunter. The same doesn't apply if the prospective beast gunner hunts the creature alone, even if they are significantly more powerful than the creature, such that the creature never stood a chance against them in a one on one fight. You're one of those who successfully completed the hunt and bonded with your prized weapon. Now, you seek to discover the hidden depths that others who think they know how to use beast guns can only imagine. Choosing Your Beast Gun A beast gunner's bond with their beast gun is deep and mystical, so if you hope to be a successful beast gunner, it's important to choose a beast gun that suits your temperament, magic, and combat style. For example, if you favor strength and intimidation, a screech shooter is the right choice for you, whereas a spider gun might be optimal if you prefer a more careful style of setting up the battlefield in advance. Similarly, a tentacle cannon is slow and methodical and can hold an enemy in place at close range, while a drake rifle is energetic and mobile and can be used to attack from a great distance. Each beast gun has a personality and magical abilities that attract people who value them. For this reason, some experienced beast gunners say the weapon chooses you.

You might wield a single pistol, a pair of pistols, or a pistol paired with a melee weapon to pull off showy maneuvers. However you slice it, though, the use of pistols or other one-handed firearms is crucial to your technique and style.\n\n To you, everything is a show, and you use your gun as a prop and instrument, not just to kill opponents but to trick, mislead, hinder, and even bully them into doing what you want them to do. While others tend to focus on delivering as much devastation downrange as possible, your style is all about control. By controlling a foe's attention and actions, you can bolster your own attacks and mitigate the foe's potential for mayhem. You control the tempo of the battle much as you would a staged performance, carefully ensuring your foe's actions don't fall outside of your intended script.

As a pistol phenom, you understand how to grab everyone's attention with everything you do, especially the way you talk, the way you walk, and the way you use your gun. But what's more, you're well aware of that fact and the power you have over others, and you aren't afraid to flaunt it.\n\n Despite this attitude, or perhaps because of it, as a pistol phenom you likely tend to get along well with groups of allies, understanding both how to take the spotlight to protect your allies and how to share it to make sure they get their time in the sun. The one exception to this can be other pistol phenoms. When two or more pistol phenoms gather in the same group, it's almost inevitable for a duel or other contest to arise. However, such a contest need not end in enmity. Depending on your temperament, and that of the other pistol phenom, the result of the exhilarating rivalry expressed during competition could be a lifelong friendship, albeit one in which you both keep score of your greatest achievements to compare exploits.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Additional Feats</title>\r\n\r\nThis archetype has some feats at a level other than their original level.\r\nSuch feats are marked with a \\*.\r\n\r\n[Click here for the full rules on Additional Feats](/Rules.aspx?ID=1432).\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3251\" />\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3252\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3159\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 4*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3253\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3254\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3255\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3256\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3188\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 12*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3257\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3202\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 16*\"\r\n\r\n/>","name":"Pistol Phenom","pfs":"Standard","prerequisite":"trained in at least one type of one-handed firearm; Trained in Deception; Trained in Performance","prerequisite_markdown":"trained in at least one type of one-handed firearm; Trained in [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5); Trained in [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12)","primary_source":"Guns & Gears","primary_source_raw":"Guns & Gears pg. 136","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"uncommon","rarity_id":2,"release_date":"2021-10-13","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Guns &amp; Gears](/Sources.aspx?ID=98) pg. 136 <sup>2.0</sup>\r\n\r\n**Prerequisites**\r\ntrained in at least one type of one-handed firearm; Trained in [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5); Trained in [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12)\n\n**Archetype Categories**\r\nCombat Style, Core\r\n\r\n**Number of Feats** 10\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nYou treat combat as an art and your pistol as an extension of your performance.

You might wield a single pistol, a pair of pistols, or a pistol paired with a melee weapon to pull off showy maneuvers. However you slice it, though, the use of pistols or other one-handed firearms is crucial to your technique and style. To you, everything is a show, and you use your gun as a prop and instrument, not just to kill opponents but to trick, mislead, hinder, and even bully them into doing what you want them to do. While others tend to focus on delivering as much devastation downrange as possible, your style is all about control. By controlling a foe's attention and actions, you can bolster your own attacks and mitigate the foe's potential for mayhem. You control the tempo of the battle much as you would a staged performance, carefully ensuring your foe's actions don't fall outside of your intended script. You're both the director and the star of this show, and your enemies dance to the tune you play with your pistol... sometimes quite literally! What Makes a Phenom? Many gunslingers can learn how to twirl a pistol or intimidate a foe, but it's not just your skills that make you a phenom, it's your style and attitude. As a pistol phenom, you understand how to grab everyone's attention with everything you do, especially the way you talk, the way you walk, and the way you use your gun. But what's more, you're well aware of that fact and the power you have over others, and you aren't afraid to flaunt it. Despite this attitude, or perhaps because of it, as a pistol phenom you likely tend to get along well with groups of allies, understanding both how to take the spotlight to protect your allies and how to share it to make sure they get their time in the sun. The one exception to this can be other pistol phenoms. When two or more pistol phenoms gather in the same group, it's almost inevitable for a duel or other contest to arise. However, such a contest need not end in enmity. Depending on your temperament, and that of the other pistol phenom, the result of the exhilarating rivalry expressed during competition could be a lifelong friendship, albeit one in which you both keep score of your greatest achievements to compare exploits.

Your character at first seems like they bumble into their successes through sheer circumstance. However, when the circumstances pile up, others might start to suspect another possibility: perhaps your character is secretly so incredible that they not only achieve impressive results but do so in a way that hides their skill behind a veneer of lucky breaks. Ultimately, either could be true about your character, or some combination of both. You might decide the truth together with the GM as soon as you take this archetype or hold off until later to make that call. Because this archetype hints at hidden talent intentionally obfuscated, it offers a good choice for a character who's secretly more powerful or skilled than they seem or who must hide their abilities for some reason—perhaps associated with the plot of the campaign.\n\n If your inclination is to play a character who hides their abilities, consider training in the [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) skill and taking skill feats like [Charming Liar](/Feats.aspx?ID=766) and [Confabulator](/Feats.aspx?ID=769) that emphasize your character's crafty nature and skill at concealing their true intent.\n\n If you instead prefer to play a character who's legitimately a bit uncoordinated but abnormally lucky, you might choose to pursue actions that have a high chance of earning you a Hero Point.

Others say that, given the circumstances and the number of foes who you've defeated seemingly by accident, that there's no way you can really be as incompetent as you seem. These critics claim there has to be some kind of angle, some racket you're running. Either way, you sure don't look or act dangerous, except possibly to yourself. Somehow, despite your apparent clumsiness, professed confusion, and known propensity to incite calamity, you find yourself standing after every battle. The same can't often be said for your enemies. Funny how that works out, isn't it? Skilled or Lucky Part of the fun of roleplaying an unexpected sharpshooter is the ambiguity and mystery of how your character achieves their surprising success. Your character at first seems like they bumble into their successes through sheer circumstance. However, when the circumstances pile up, others might start to suspect another possibility: perhaps your character is secretly so incredible that they not only achieve impressive results but do so in a way that hides their skill behind a veneer of lucky breaks. Ultimately, either could be true about your character, or some combination of both. You might decide the truth together with the GM as soon as you take this archetype or hold off until later to make that call. Because this archetype hints at hidden talent intentionally obfuscated, it offers a good choice for a character who's secretly more powerful or skilled than they seem or who must hide their abilities for some reason—perhaps associated with the plot of the campaign. If your inclination is to play a character who hides their abilities, consider training in the Deception skill and taking skill feats like Charming Liar and Confabulator that emphasize your character's crafty nature and skill at concealing their true intent. If you instead prefer to play a character who's legitimately a bit uncoordinated but abnormally lucky, you might choose to pursue actions that have a high chance of earning you a Hero Point. You could also consider taking abilities with the fortune or misfortune traits, such as Halfling Luck or Harbinger's Caw.

At the GM's discretion, a spell trickster feat could be made available to a character as a class feat without the character taking the archetype. In most cases, this option should only be offered as a reward or story element that the character, GM, or group has dedicated a significant amount of time to developing—a character who wishes to partake in these options without GM permission or involvement should simply take the spell trickster archetype. These feats could be used to represent the payoff from extended magical research; finding forgotten or forbidden lore in a lost corner of Golarion; pleasing a god, patron, or other notable power; a magical plane or artifact exerting its influence; or any other number of situations that an adventurer might encounter while exploring. Keep in mind, however, that these feats were created and balanced to be part of an archetype. If allowing spell trickster feats as general class feats begins to negatively impact the game, the players should be willing to walk the decision back and rebuild characters as necessary.\r\n</aside>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3368\" />\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3369\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3370\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3371\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3372\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3373\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3374\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3375\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3376\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3377\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3378\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3379\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3380\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3381\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3382\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3383\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3384\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3385\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3386\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3387\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3388\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3389\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3390\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3391\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3392\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3393\"\n\n/>","name":"Spell Trickster","pfs":"Standard","prerequisite":"Able to cast spells; Trained in Arcana, Trained in Nature, Trained in Occultism, or Trained in Religion","prerequisite_markdown":"Able to cast spells; Trained in [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), Trained in [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10), Trained in [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11), or Trained in [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)","primary_source":"Grand Bazaar","primary_source_raw":"Grand Bazaar pg. 122","primary_source_category":"Lost Omens","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2021-10-13","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Grand Bazaar](/Sources.aspx?ID=100) pg. 122\r\n\r\n**Prerequisites**\r\nAble to cast spells; Trained in [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2), Trained in [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10), Trained in [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11), or Trained in [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13)\n\n**Archetype Category**\r\nMystical\r\n\r\n**Number of Feats** 26\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nJust as Golarion's merchants scour busy marketplaces for newfound goods, scholars of magic congregate in teahouses, debate at symposia, and haunt the …\r\n</summary>","skill_mod":{},"source":["Grand Bazaar"],"source_raw":["Grand Bazaar pg. 122"],"source_category":["Lost Omens"],"source_markdown":"[Grand Bazaar](/Sources.aspx?ID=100) pg. 122","speed":{},"summary":"Just as Golarion's merchants scour busy marketplaces for newfound goods, scholars of magic congregate in teahouses, debate at symposia, and haunt the …","summary_markdown":"Just as Golarion's merchants scour busy marketplaces for newfound goods, scholars of magic congregate in teahouses, debate at symposia, and haunt the …","text":" Spell Trickster Source Grand Bazaar pg. 122 Just as Golarion's merchants scour busy marketplaces for newfound goods, scholars of magic congregate in teahouses, debate at symposia, and haunt the back rooms of esoteric shops to swap secrets of their trade.

At the GM's discretion, a spell trickster feat could be made available to a character as a class feat without the character taking the archetype. In most cases, this option should only be offered as a reward or story element that the character, GM, or group has dedicated a significant amount of time to developing—a character who wishes to partake in these options without GM permission or involvement should simply take the spell trickster archetype. These feats could be used to represent the payoff from extended magical research; finding forgotten or forbidden lore in a lost corner of Golarion; pleasing a god, patron, or other notable power; a magical plane or artifact exerting its influence; or any other number of situations that an adventurer might encounter while exploring. Keep in mind, however, that these feats were created and balanced to be part of an archetype. If allowing spell trickster feats as general class feats begins to negatively impact the game, the players should be willing to walk the decision back and rebuild characters as necessary. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3369\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3370\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3371\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3372\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3373\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3374\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3375\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3376\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3377\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3378\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3379\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3380\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3381\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3382\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3383\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3384\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3385\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3386\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3387\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3388\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3389\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3390\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3391\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3392\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3393\" />","trait_markdown":"","type":"Archetype","url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=126","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"archetype-127","_score":4.88543,"_source":{"archetype":["Wrestler"],"archetype_category":["Combat Style"],"category":"archetype","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"archetype-127","level":2,"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Archetype 2\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Wrestler](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=127)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\n\n**Source** [Grand Bazaar](/Sources.aspx?ID=100) pg. 126\n\nWrestlers are athletes who pit their strength and skill against powerful foes.

Over time, this pact slowly changes the initiate internally and, sometimes, externally as well. The initiate's mind slowly fills with ancient pieces of lore and techniques that are as much part of the saumen kar as their hands and feet. As the initiate's mind adapts to this knowledge and power, their body sometimes evolves in kind—sprouting sweeping horns, gaining heightened olfactory senses, and growing additional height and muscle—becoming a hybrid between their old ancestry and saumen kar, wrapped in runic tattoos.\n\n An unwilling creature can never be forced to become a pactbound initiate, and only those with deep bonds of mutual friendship with a saumen kar can even attempt the process. Befriending a saumen kar can be enough to begin one's initiation into the pact, though they must choose to accept the burden and can change their minds about undertaking the pact at any point until their final transition (represented by the Bound in Ice feat). Once a creature has completed the pact by accepting the full burden of a saumen kar and taking the Bound in Ice feat, all transformations are permanent. At that point, they can't retrain the Pactbound Dedication, Frostbite Runes, or Bound in Ice feats and must live out the rest of their lives as something between their old ancestry and a saumen kar. If their normal lifespan was less than 400 years, it's increased to at least 400 years. If their natural lifespan was greater than 400 years, it's instead reduced to approximately that amount of time.\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-3414\" />\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3415\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3416\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3417\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3418\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-3419\"\n\n/>","name":"Pactbound Initiate","pfs":"Standard","prerequisite":"Trained in Nature; Erutaki or Giant language, must have earned the trust of a saumen kar who initiates you into the archetype","prerequisite_markdown":"Trained in [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10); [Erutaki](/Languages.aspx?ID=54) or [Giant](/Languages.aspx?ID=8) language, must have earned the trust of a saumen kar who initiates you into the archetype","primary_source":"Monsters of Myth","primary_source_raw":"Monsters of Myth pg. 10","primary_source_category":"Lost Omens","rarity":"rare","rarity_id":3,"release_date":"2021-12-22","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Monsters of Myth](/Sources.aspx?ID=107) pg. 10\r\n\r\n**Prerequisites**\r\nTrained in [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10); [Erutaki](/Languages.aspx?ID=54) or [Giant](/Languages.aspx?ID=8) language, must have earned the trust of a saumen kar who initiates you into the archetype\n\n**Archetype Category**\r\nMystical\r\n\r\n**Number of Feats** 6\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nSaumen kar can initiate a member of another ancestry into their pact, imbuing the creature with their power and their curse.

Many tap into these powers with no consideration of the morality of their use. For these unscrupulous magic users, it's simply another avenue in their never-ending pursuit of power, and the abilities learned are turned to the caster's personal ends, whatever they may be.\n\n Others choose a different path. Through spiritual study and introspection, they have come to recognize the evil intrinsic in the existence of [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160), the fundamental wrongness of using the universal energy of death to create an appearance of life. To combat this evil, these casters learn to conduct positive energy and direct it to great effect against the undead they encounter. They may also engage in ongoing study to learn of the nature of life, death, and undeath, and the precise relationship between each state. These scholars and mages are commonly known as hallowed necromancers—a slightly misrepresentative name, as many of them don't use religious methods, but a frequently used shorthand regardless.\n\n The exact origin of hallowed necromancers' abilities may vary from one to the next. Some are granted their gifts directly by a sympathetic deity such as [Sarenrae](/Deities.aspx?ID=16) or [Pharasma](/Deities.aspx?ID=14), while others might use their knowledge of religion and the planes to learn such abilities on their own. Though rarer, it's even possible these practitioners might discover they possess an intuitive understanding and control over abilities that manifest spontaneously as their capabilities grow.

Many tap into these powers with no consideration of the morality of their use. For these unscrupulous magic users, it's simply another avenue in their never-ending pursuit of power, and the abilities learned are turned to the caster's personal ends, whatever they may be. Others choose a different path. Through spiritual study and introspection, they have come to recognize the evil intrinsic in the existence of undead, the fundamental wrongness of using the universal energy of death to create an appearance of life. To combat this evil, these casters learn to conduct positive energy and direct it to great effect against the undead they encounter. They may also engage in ongoing study to learn of the nature of life, death, and undeath, and the precise relationship between each state. These scholars and mages are commonly known as hallowed necromancers—a slightly misrepresentative name, as many of them don't use religious methods, but a frequently used shorthand regardless. The exact origin of hallowed necromancers' abilities may vary from one to the next. Some are granted their gifts directly by a sympathetic deity such as Sarenrae or Pharasma, while others might use their knowledge of religion and the planes to learn such abilities on their own. Though rarer, it's even possible these practitioners might discover they possess an intuitive understanding and control over abilities that manifest spontaneously as their capabilities grow.

Despite the trials you underwent and decades spent sequestered away with magical tomes, you know with every fiber of your being that it's all been worth it. You devised a unique and incredibly evil ritual to tear your soul from your body, and you painstakingly crafted a receptacle to house your freed soul. Immortality now lies within your grasp.\n\n Becoming a lich requires much more than just magical knowledge. It demands fierce intelligence, bold ingenuity, incredible determination, unending patience, and a strict adherence to perfection, along with incredible skill as an artisan, for each lich must create their own _soul cage_. A mispronounced word or flaw in the construction of your _soul cage_ would end not in immortality but ignominious death. You have all these skills in abundance and now, with your ascension, you've proven your superiority beyond a shadow of a doubt.\n\n As a lich, you understand better than any the power and potential of magic. Many liches strive to increase their magical skills and foil the magic of any who dare oppose them. Others delve so deeply into necromantic arts and foul rituals that their flesh can burn the living, causing biological processes to falter and filling those who behold them with uncontrollable fear.\n\n Regardless of what paths they pursue, nearly all liches are obsessed with their _soul cage_, spending untold hours and a veritable fortune to protect it, surrounding it with magical and mundane hazards, and guarding it with powerful, loyal defenders. Some liches prefer to secure their _soul cage_ through obscurity rather than force, enshrouding it in magical abjurations or illusions to hide it from prying eyes. The most gifted crafters among liches tinker and improve their _soul cage_ over time, rendering it nigh indestructible. This is a dangerous proposition, undertaken by only the most confident and arrogant magical engineers, as physically altering one's _soul cage_ could have unintended consequences on its function. Many [wizard](/Classes.aspx?ID=12) liches instead learn to tap into the _soul cage_'s magical energy from afar to fuel their own spellcasting.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Soul Cage</title>\r\n\r\nThe _[soul cage](/Equipment.aspx?ID=1545)_ for the lich archetype is very similar to the [_lich soul cage_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=488) from the _Pathfinder Bestiary_ but has a few modifications to cover situations that might come up in play.\n\n While the story of the PCs sneaking in to destroy the NPC lich's _soul cage_ is classic, it's difficult to have NPC adversaries do the same to the PC lich's _soul cage_ without coming across poorly, similar to destroying a PC wizard's spellbook while it was off screen.

Despite the …","text":" Lich Source Book of the Dead pg. 50 The path to lichdom is long and winding, with many pitfalls that overcome all but the most accomplished and precise spellcasters. Despite the trials you underwent and decades spent sequestered away with magical tomes, you know with every fiber of your being that it's all been worth it. You devised a unique and incredibly evil ritual to tear your soul from your body, and you painstakingly crafted a receptacle to house your freed soul. Immortality now lies within your grasp. Becoming a lich requires much more than just magical knowledge. It demands fierce intelligence, bold ingenuity, incredible determination, unending patience, and a strict adherence to perfection, along with incredible skill as an artisan, for each lich must create their own soul cage . A mispronounced word or flaw in the construction of your soul cage would end not in immortality but ignominious death. You have all these skills in abundance and now, with your ascension, you've proven your superiority beyond a shadow of a doubt. As a lich, you understand better than any the power and potential of magic. Many liches strive to increase their magical skills and foil the magic of any who dare oppose them. Others delve so deeply into necromantic arts and foul rituals that their flesh can burn the living, causing biological processes to falter and filling those who behold them with uncontrollable fear. Regardless of what paths they pursue, nearly all liches are obsessed with their soul cage , spending untold hours and a veritable fortune to protect it, surrounding it with magical and mundane hazards, and guarding it with powerful, loyal defenders. Some liches prefer to secure their soul cage through obscurity rather than force, enshrouding it in magical abjurations or illusions to hide it from prying eyes. The most gifted crafters among liches tinker and improve their soul cage over time, rendering it nigh indestructible. This is a dangerous proposition, undertaken by only the most confident and arrogant magical engineers, as physically altering one's soul cage could have unintended consequences on its function. Many wizard liches instead learn to tap into the soul cage 's magical energy from afar to fuel their own spellcasting. Soul Cage The soul cage for the lich archetype is very similar to the lich soul cage from the Pathfinder Bestiary but has a few modifications to cover situations that might come up in play. While the story of the PCs sneaking in to destroy the NPC lich's soul cage is classic, it's difficult to have NPC adversaries do the same to the PC lich's soul cage without coming across poorly, similar to destroying a PC wizard's spellbook while it was off screen. Since that's the only way to defeat a lich, these table-dynamic concerns might effectively grant the lich PC immortality. Because of the way that changes the story and game play, even a group using the other undead archetypes in this book might want to consider whether or not to include the lich archetype. If you're looking for a compromise, consider having the soul cage act similarly to a Rejuvenation Token, requiring a ritual to awaken the lich's soul from within the cage.

One day you might be nothing more than a walking corpse, but for now, you retain your personality and your free will. Feeding your hunger might allow you to remain that way.

Rather than skulking through the shadows, you use your training and latent supernatural abilities to become a mirror, playing on the perceptions of others and taking on whatever role necessary to get in and out of your destination before anyone has a chance to think something is amiss.\n\n Performing an alter ego means going unregarded. Passing as just a face in the crowd is crucial, and accolades come as the gratitude from your leaders or coin from your clients, rather than the awed adoration from a crowd. This arrangement might suit you fine, as you thrive in a job well done and on the thrill of walking flagrantly past your duped adversaries. Or it might become pent up, until you can't resist a dramatic reveal or a signature calling card that shows you were there. One final word before speeding away from the castle, a gloating message left behind, or some other sign reveals your skill—usually too late for your victims to do anything about it.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Alter Egos in Golarion</title>\r\n\r\nWhile some alter egos work independently as freelancers, they're especially popular in all sorts of espionage and intelligence agencies throughout the Inner Sea and beyond.

Rather than skulking through the shadows, you use your training and latent supernatural abilities to become a mirror, playing on the perceptions of others and taking on whatever role necessary to get in and out of your destination before anyone has a chance to think something is amiss. Performing an alter ego means going unregarded. Passing as just a face in the crowd is crucial, and accolades come as the gratitude from your leaders or coin from your clients, rather than the awed adoration from a crowd. This arrangement might suit you fine, as you thrive in a job well done and on the thrill of walking flagrantly past your duped adversaries. Or it might become pent up, until you can't resist a dramatic reveal or a signature calling card that shows you were there. One final word before speeding away from the castle, a gloating message left behind, or some other sign reveals your skill—usually too late for your victims to do anything about it.

The professional reanimator can never quite cover up the stench of their grim work.\n\n The mark left by the practice of time magic is less obvious but no less indelible. With other disciplines, the marks of experience accumulate as magic is learned, creating an equilibrium of sorts between the exercise of power and the necessary consequences. Time magic suffers no such limitations of cause and effect.

The veteran pyromancer bears the scorch marks of lessons learned. The archdruid grows to resemble plants or animals in their domain or grove. The professional reanimator can never quite cover up the stench of their grim work. The mark left by the practice of time magic is less obvious but no less indelible. With other disciplines, the marks of experience accumulate as magic is learned, creating an equilibrium of sorts between the exercise of power and the necessary consequences. Time magic suffers no such limitations of cause and effect.

But recently, particularly as Varisia's importance in Avistan has grown, harrowers have begun to spread across the world of Golarion. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4154\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4155\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4156\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4157\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4158\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4159\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-4160\" />","trait":["Uncommon"],"trait_group":["Rarity"],"trait_markdown":"[Uncommon](/Traits.aspx?ID=159)","trait_raw":["Uncommon"],"type":"Archetype","url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=204","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"archetype-205","_score":4.88543,"_source":{"access":"You are a  dwarf  or have undergone defender training in a dwarven settlement such as Highhelm.","archetype":["Stalwart Defender"],"archetype_category":["Combat Style"],"category":"archetype","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"archetype-205","level":2,"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Archetype 2\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Stalwart Defender](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=205)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\n\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n</traits>\n\n**Source** [Highhelm](/Sources.aspx?ID=204) pg. 110\n\nThe military history of the [dwarves](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=1) is a story of largely defensive combat and tactics, whether it be as simple as guarding a camp during the Quest for Sky or a protracted siege, such as at the Sky Citadel of Kraggodan.

Secrets of Magic Elementalist : This section updates and expands the elementalist class archetype originally presented on page 206 of Secrets of Magic . If you're using the version of the archetype from Secrets of Magic and are happy with it, you don't need to make any changes—that original version functions the same as using the new text and choosing Inner Sea elementalism for your elemental philosophy! Elemental Magic (1st) You're a spellcaster who specializes in harnessing the elements. Though you might feel a kinship for one element over the others, you're capable of shaping many of them. Due to your specialization in elemental magic, you have a smaller, more focused spell list than other spellcasters, though your magic is drawn from multiple traditions. If you choose this class archetype, you must select the Elementalist Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat. Prerequisites : You must have a spellcasting class feature that chooses spells from the arcane or primal spell list. Elementalist Adjustments : Replace your spell list with the elemental spell list. Your actual magical tradition is unchanged, but you choose your spells from the elemental list instead. You must choose an elemental philosophy (detailed below), which determines which spells and other elemental magic you can use. Druid Elementalist Adjustments : If you're a druid of the storm order and air is in your elemental philosophy, you can choose to replace your starting order spell, tempest surge , with updraft . Elemental Sorcerer Adjustments : If you're a sorcerer with the elemental bloodline, you can replace your initial bloodline spell with an initial elemental focus spell, and your advanced bloodline spell with an advanced elemental focus spell. The initial and advanced elemental focus spells you select must have the same trait as your elemental bloodline. Wizard Elementalist Adjustments : If you're a wizard, you can either choose to be a universalist or to follow an arcane school dedicated to one element from your elemental philosophy. If you choose an elemental school, your curriculum spells can be any spells that you have access to and that have your chosen element's trait.

The options available in this book are as follows. Elemental Cycle : Earth, fire, metal, water, wood Inner Sea Elementalism : Air, earth, fire, water Your choice of elemental philosophy affects your spell list, with the spell list for elemental cycle elementalists found here and the spell list for the inner sea elementalist found here. In addition to some universal spells that both philosophies have access to, your personal list also contains any spell that shares one or more traits with those in your elemental philosophy, and doesn't have any traits that aren't in your elemental philosophy. For example, an elemental cycle elementalist could choose a spell with both the earth and fire traits, but not one with the air and fire traits, while an inner sea elementalist could choose either of those, but not a spell with metal and fire traits. As Rage of Elements is the first book to include the wood and metal traits, your GM might allow you to add more spells from other books that fit the metal or wood element but first appeared without the trait, adding the relevant trait to the spell. You can't take elementalist feats or use elementalist abilities for an element you're unable to attune to.

Other spellcaster clerics diversify their options, becoming theurgic characters who combine two magical traditions. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5067\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5068\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5069\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5070\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5071\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5072\" />","trait_markdown":"","type":"Archetype","url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=212","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"archetype-213","_score":4.88543,"_source":{"archetype":["Druid"],"archetype_category":["Multiclass"],"category":"archetype","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"archetype-213","image":["/Images/Archetypes/Archetype_Druid.webp"],"legacy_id":["archetype-6"],"level":2,"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Archetype 2\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Druid](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=213)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\n\n**Source** [Player Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=216) pg. 218 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\nYou have entered a druidic circle and learned a few of the order’s secrets, granting you primal power.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Archetypes/Archetype_Druid.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Multiclass Druid characters</title>\r\n\r\nThe druid archetype can provide a bit of healing or elemental damage and can increase your utility in a natural environment with spells like [_speak with animals_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1680) and [_one with stone_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1619).\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5073\" />\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-5074\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-5075\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-5076\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-5077\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-5078\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-5079\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-5080\"\n\n/>","name":"Druid","pfs":"Standard","prerequisite":"Wisdom +2","prerequisite_markdown":"Wisdom +2","primary_source":"Player Core","primary_source_raw":"Player Core pg. 218","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2023-11-15","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Player Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=216) pg. 218 <sup>2.0</sup>\r\n\r\n**Prerequisites**\r\nWisdom +2\n\n**Archetype Category**\r\nMulticlass\r\n\r\n**Number of Feats** 8\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nYou have entered a druidic circle and learned a few of the order’s secrets, granting you primal power.\r\n</summary>","skill_mod":{},"source":["Player Core"],"source_raw":["Player Core pg. 218"],"source_category":["Rulebooks"],"source_markdown":"[Player Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=216) pg. 218 <sup>2.0</sup>","speed":{},"summary":"You have entered a druidic circle and learned a few of the order’s secrets, granting you primal power.","summary_markdown":"You have entered a druidic circle and learned a few of the order’s secrets, granting you primal power.","text":" Druid Source Player Core pg. 218 2.0 You have entered a druidic circle and learned a few of the order’s secrets, granting you primal power.

Others selectively cultivate one kind of insect precious to them into various morphs that give the swarm new capabilities. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5464\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5465\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5466\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5467\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5468\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5469\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5470\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5471\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5472\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5473\" />","trait":["Uncommon"],"trait_group":["Rarity"],"trait_markdown":"[Uncommon](/Traits.aspx?ID=721)","trait_raw":["Uncommon"],"type":"Archetype","url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=223","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"archetype-224","_score":4.88543,"_source":{"archetype":["Thlipit Contestant"],"archetype_category":["Profession","Core"],"category":"archetype","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"archetype-224","level":2,"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Archetype 2\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Thlipit Contestant](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=224)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\n\n**Source** [Howl of the Wild](/Sources.aspx?ID=226) pg. 74 <sup>2.1</sup>\n\nAccording to folklore, the thlipit martial art began with a wager.

With the curse both spreading infectiously and robbing the afflicted control of their actions, those suspected of being werecreatures can rarely live in peace.\n\nWhile many werecreatures have little control over their own transformations, formal training or an exceptionally strong will has enabled you to exert a degree of mastery over the beast that rages within you, allowing you not only to assume your bestial shape at will but also retain your own mind while doing so. In many cases, this results in being able to prevent spreading the curse as well.

From the capacity to fight through deadly wounds to the production of painful electric jolts, the multitude of the world’s beasts presents a staggering array of diversity in form. Through rigorous training of your body, the meticulous study of treatises on wildlife, or by spending a large portion of your life among them, you have learned to adopt the martial techniques of many beasts.

It's especially good for characters looking to add more damage. Alchemist barbarians can enhance themselves with potent mutagens before releasing their fury.

Monk barbarians can use the enhanced emotional state of rage to flow with their stance. Rogue barbarians are ruffians who thrive in a scrap and are happy to let their anger take control.

Multiclass Swashbuckler Characters The swashbuckler archetype is a great fit for martial characters who want to be a bit flashier or for Charismabased spellcasters who want to add a bit of dramatic flair to their routine. Multiclass swashbucklers work especially well for characters who already want to incorporate skill-based action and seek out daring deeds to do in the heat of battle. Barbarian swashbucklers love to show off their strength and brutality with devastating finishers. Champion swashbucklers can show off the powers of their deity to inspire awe in potential converts and fear in enemies of the faith. Investigator swashbucklers might love to solve big cases with an audience to show off their prowess. Monk swashbucklers can take full advantage of their perfectly trained bodies to perform impressive feats. Rogue swashbucklers might hide in the shadows before emerging to put on a flashy show. Spellcaster swashbucklers might want to show off their mastery of both martial and magical arts. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6234\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6235\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6236\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6237\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6238\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6239\" />","trait_markdown":"","type":"Archetype","url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=235","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"archetype-236","_score":4.88543,"_source":{"archetype":["Acrobat"],"archetype_category":["Profession","Core"],"category":"archetype","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"archetype-236","image":["/Images/Archetypes/Archetype_Acrobat.webp"],"legacy_id":["archetype-45"],"level":2,"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Archetype 2\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Acrobat](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=236)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\n\n**Source** [Player Core 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=227) pg. 183 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\nYou have trained your body to perform incredible, seemingly superhuman feats of grace and agility.

This blessing manifests as the ability to heal wounds and remove harmful conditions, and exists independent of any worship. You might offer gratitude daily to the deity whose power you wield, or you might carry these blessings reluctantly, seeking to avoid responsibility or even openly acting to defy the deity's influence on you. You might wear the robes of the deity's order, or you might give little thought and even less reverence to the source of your powers. However you feel about these potent gifts, there can be no doubt that you wield a special power. Benevolent deities are most likely to empower a blessed one. However, any deity can grant such a blessing, as long as they're capable of granting a healing divine font to their clerics. This means such deities as Lamashtu might grant the blessed one's powers for their own purposes. Despite this possibility, it's quite uncommon for deities of cruelty, death, and destruction to grant the power of rejuvenation. When this does occur, the deity usually has a malicious intent behind the gift. Ultimately, you decide how you will use this gift. Will you aid the deity who granted you this power, or will you work in defiance of them?\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Archetypes/Archetype_Blessed_One.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<title level=\"3\">Additional Feats</title>\r\n\r\nThis archetype has some feats at a level other than their original level.\r\nSuch feats are marked with a \\*.\r\n\r\n[Click here for the full rules on Additional Feats](/Rules.aspx?ID=1432).\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6277\" />\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6278\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-5897\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 6*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6279\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-5904\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 10*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6280\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-5912\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 14*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-5927\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 20*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-5929\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 20*\"\r\n\r\n/>","name":"Blessed One","pfs":"Standard","primary_source":"Player Core 2","primary_source_raw":"Player Core 2 pg. 190","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2024-08-01","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Player Core 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=227) pg. 190 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n**Archetype Categories**\r\nMystical, Core\r\n\r\n**Number of Feats** 9\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nThrough luck or deed, heritage or heroics, you carry the blessing of a deity.

You might offer gratitude daily to the deity whose power you wield, or you might carry these blessings reluctantly, seeking to avoid responsibility or even openly acting to defy the deity's influence on you. You might wear the robes of the deity's order, or you might give little thought and even less reverence to the source of your powers. However you feel about these potent gifts, there can be no doubt that you wield a special power. Benevolent deities are most likely to empower a blessed one. However, any deity can grant such a blessing, as long as they're capable of granting a healing divine font to their clerics. This means such deities as Lamashtu might grant the blessed one's powers for their own purposes. Despite this possibility, it's quite uncommon for deities of cruelty, death, and destruction to grant the power of rejuvenation. When this does occur, the deity usually has a malicious intent behind the gift. Ultimately, you decide how you will use this gift. Will you aid the deity who granted you this power, or will you work in defiance of them? Additional Feats This archetype has some feats at a level other than their original level.

Specializing in a variety of grabs, holds, and strikes, wrestlers are dangerous opponents whose techniques can leave a foe broken and defeated without taking their life. Though it appears brutal, wrestling is considered a respectable and innocuous art.\n\n The wrestling tradition is common all over Golarion. Gladiators and other warriors who fight for entertainment use wrestling techniques in combat. The discipline's focus on grappling is also useful in non-gladiatorial matches, as many foes are unable to contend with an opponent's hold. Grappling is particularly effective against spellcasters, who have a difficult time completing the gestures for their spells while grabbed. However, with the right technique, a seasoned wrestler can hold down just about any foe standing in their way. Such wrestlers are feared by their foes and respected by their allies.\n\n Wrestlers have storied traditions in the Hold of Belkzen, where orcs employ specialized grappling techniques to subdue the large animals they ride as mounts. Orcs prefer wrestling these creatures partially to minimize harm to them, but also because they believe that the process of subduing them in this manner creates a stronger bond between mount and rider.\n\n Outside of the Inner Sea, wrestlers are common in Iblydos and Arcadia. Iblydan wrestlers focus on powerful grappling techniques to make sure theyfre never left without a means to fight on the battlefield, even if their weapons are destroyed. Arcadian wrestlers engage in matches designed to retell stories of ancient gods and their past battles.

From the most gilded palace in Goka all the way to the most hidden campfire in the Valashmai Jungle, communities gather to prepare and consume food together. In a very real way, civilization is built around it. From the structure of cities around agriculture, to the calendars and their planting and harvest seasons, to the rise and fall of days around communal mealtimes, people must eat. Wandering Chef No matter where you go in Tian Xia, one thing you can always find with some reliability is good food. Tian Xia’s many talented chefs practice a wide array of cooking techniques, and many can be found traveling between the continent’s states and regions as frequently as any adventurer. Chefs from Zi Ha wander to expand their knowledge of cooking techniques, while culinarians from the Lung Wa Successor States visit foreign courts to display their pride in their regional cuisine. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7054\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7055\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7056\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7057\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7058\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7059\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7060\" />","trait_markdown":"","type":"Archetype","url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=277","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"archetype-278","_score":4.88543,"_source":{"archetype":["Cultivator"],"archetype_category":["Combat Style"],"category":"archetype","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"archetype-278","level":2,"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Archetype 2\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Cultivator](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=278)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\n\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=683\" />\r\n</traits>\n\n**Source** [Tian Xia Character Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=230) pg. 114\n\nCultivators are seekers of immortality who practice occult disciplines to refine their qi.

There exists, however, other corners of religious power that churches may be less open about with their lay worshippers. Avengers are one such example. Sometimes known as slayers among more brutal doctrines, avengers are trained in remote monasteries or secret cloisters hidden from the eyes of casual passersby. They are indoctrinated in their church’s teachings while being taught a variety of martial skills, many focused around mastery of their deity’s favored weapon. These training environments often also enforce vows of silence, vows of celibacy, or other practices intended to keep the avengers-in-training from forming strong personal attachments. Avenger 1st Trained far from watching eyes, you use stealth, intimidation, and deadly bladework to root out threats to your church. You must select Avenger Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat. Prerequisites: You must be a rogue. Avenger Adjustments: You must choose a deity to be a follower of. You are trained in Intimidation, Religion, Stealth, the divine skill granted by your racket, and a number of additional skills equal to 3 plus your Intelligence modifier, instead of your normal starting skill proficiencies. You must choose the avenger racket (below) for your rogue’s racket. You do not gain the surprise attack class feature. You gain the Hunt Prey action. Avenger Racket Trained to be a precise but brutal weapon by the priests of your faith, you eschew complex trickery for swift and deadly efficiency. Subtlety and deception have their uses, but when a false smile fails, your blades have their own way of finding the truth. You are trained in your deity’s favored weapon. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency with simple or martial weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank with your deity’s favored weapon. You can deal sneak attack damage to your prey with your deity’s favored weapon, in addition to the weapons listed in the sneak attack class feature. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using your deity’s favored weapon and the target has the off-guard condition, you also apply the weapon’s critical specialization effect. You’re trained in your deity’s divine skill and medium armor; if you’re already trained in your deity’s divine skill, you are instead trained in another skill of your choice. You can choose Strength as your key attribute modifier.

Vindicators are skilled warriors who use keen analytical talents and a smattering of divine magic to seek out such monstrous prey and pronounce judgment upon them. Evil religions, whose vindicators are more likely to be referred to as “inquisitors,” occasionally train their agents to seek out heretics within their own ranks, a fact that contributes heavily to the attitudes of fear and mistrust many vindicators find themselves faced with in the course of their duties. Vindicator 1st You have been specially trained to use guile and magic to reveal hidden threats. You must select Vindicator Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat. Prerequisites: You must be a ranger. Vindicator Adjustments: You must choose a deity to be a follower of, and you gain your deity's sanctification. You are trained in Religion instead of Nature. You are trained in your deity's favored weapon. If your deity's favored weapon is a simple weapon or unarmed attack with a damage die smaller than d6, you gain the Deadly Simplicity feat.

You learn warden spells as divine spells instead of primal spells, and your spellcasting attribute is Wisdom.

A beast lord is defined by their bond with their companion, an unshakable union that cannot be broken. This link can be brought forth through deific intervention, a traumatic shared event between companions that solidified their connection in magic, or even simply through a powerful friendship. A beast lord is not simply a title by which to measure those who unite with their companions, it is a collective merging of minds and souls. It’s been proposed that while the heart of one companion still beats, the other’s cannot cease, two drums in a perpetual song forever destined to be together as one. Stories of beast lords see them arising from their long-lost or secret dens to protect the lands, other companions, or lost members of their domains even long after most believed them dead and gone. These legends suggest that while even one life still lives, regardless of how many generations have passed, a beast lord can return to defend, and sometimes lead, those under their protection. \n\nWhile this archetype is called “beast lord,” your companion need not be an animal. A wizened [druid](/Classes.aspx?ID=34) might preach the [Green Faith](/Deities.aspx?ID=298) alongside a similarly weathered arboreal companion. An elven ranger might patrol the skies above their forest home on a riding [drake](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=404). An ingenious [inventor](/Classes.aspx?ID=19) might construct a robotic ally to aid in his workshop. What is important is that the beast lord has a strong bond with a companion, and that the two work hand-in-hand, almost sharing one mind.\n\nAcross the Inner Sea Region, **Adowyn** (untamed female human hunter) and **Leryn** (protective male wolf companion) travel protecting sacred natural lands and hunting those unfortunate enough to draw their ire. Their most recent exploits involved stopping an illegal strip-mining operation in the foothills of the Mindspin Mountains. \n\nIn the Mwangi Expanse, a young kobold named of **Vidni** (charismatic nonbinary kobold merchant) travels in hopes of selling their varied wares, keeping their most trusted friend and bodyguard **Hew** (fearsome male gorilla companion) close. The two have found some success in Senghor, and are saving up to buy their first trading ship. \n\nIn the Verduran Forest of Avistan, **Gal** (clever female centaur ranger) moves hoof in hoof with her boar companion **Jinx** (steadfast female boar companion), plunging tusk and arrow into the hearts of any would-be intruders. They are friendly with the local druids who reside on the Isle of Arenway, but aren’t beholden to their politics. \n\nIn Alkenstar, the inventor **Dr. Ashley Arrowbaud** (distractable female human inventor) labored for years within her laboratory until she one day emerged with a large, arthropod-shaped metal creature marked **SC- 04910** (sturdy genderless construct companion) who almost has a will of its own. The two have recently begun to discover the sinister actions of a secret society that includes members of the administration of Dr. Arrowbaud’s alma mater, Blythir College. \n\nAny of these characters may be, or may one day become, beast lords. By sharing a deep connection and the same goals, each pair may find a cause or quest that is important to them, which could eventually transform them into figures of legend. Tales of their exploits may inspire a similar connection in others, who might soon become another beast lord. \n\nYou have forged your own union with a loyal companion. The two of you share every burden, every strife, and a clear destiny. That future, no matter what foes you face, lands you protect, or quests you pursue, always shares the commonality of your undying connection to each other. Though there will be enemies who seek to drive you apart or even send you into the hands of [Pharasma](/Deities.aspx?ID=290), they will not be able to dissolve your partnership as long as you and your companion remain true to one another. You are one unit, one body and one mind, and the tribulations and trials set against you will quickly crumble through the power of your union. \n\nYou need not travel alone, though others won’t truly understand the connection you have with one another. You and your companion may make other friends or even form intimate relationships outside of this bond. Those ties will always be secondary, however, and that may cause some jealousy or resentment. But nothing like that will ever drive a wedge between you and your companion. Those who shun or ostracize you for your bond will eventually see its power when you rise to become figures of myth whose stories will be told for the rest of eternity.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Archetypes/Archetype_Beast_Lord.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n[Click here for more rules on using this archetype.](/Rules.aspx?ID=3320)\n\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7345\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7346\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7347\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7348\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7349\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7350\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7351\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7352\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7353\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7354\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7355\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7356\"\n\n/>","name":"Beast Lord","pfs":"Limited","primary_source":"War of Immortals","primary_source_raw":"War of Immortals pg. 118","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2024-10-30","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [War of Immortals](/Sources.aspx?ID=232) pg. 118\n\n**Archetype Category**\r\nCore\r\n\r\n**Number of Feats** 12\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nThe tales of connections between man and creature are numerous across the lands, often carrying with them legends of the exploits of companions as …\r\n</summary>","skill_mod":{},"source":["War of Immortals"],"source_raw":["War of Immortals pg. 118"],"source_category":["Rulebooks"],"source_markdown":"[War of Immortals](/Sources.aspx?ID=232) pg. 118","speed":{},"summary":"The tales of connections between man and creature are numerous across the lands, often carrying with them legends of the exploits of companions as …","summary_markdown":"The tales of connections between man and creature are numerous across the lands, often carrying with them legends of the exploits of companions as …","text":" Beast Lord Source War of Immortals pg. 118 The tales of connections between man and creature are numerous across the lands, often carrying with them legends of the exploits of companions as they protect that which is dearest to them.

These legends suggest that while even one life still lives, regardless of how many generations have passed, a beast lord can return to defend, and sometimes lead, those under their protection. While this archetype is called “beast lord,” your companion need not be an animal. A wizened druid might preach the Green Faith alongside a similarly weathered arboreal companion. An elven ranger might patrol the skies above their forest home on a riding drake. An ingenious inventor might construct a robotic ally to aid in his workshop. What is important is that the beast lord has a strong bond with a companion, and that the two work hand-in-hand, almost sharing one mind. Across the Inner Sea Region, Adowyn (untamed female human hunter) and Leryn (protective male wolf companion) travel protecting sacred natural lands and hunting those unfortunate enough to draw their ire. Their most recent exploits involved stopping an illegal strip-mining operation in the foothills of the Mindspin Mountains. In the Mwangi Expanse, a young kobold named of Vidni (charismatic nonbinary kobold merchant) travels in hopes of selling their varied wares, keeping their most trusted friend and bodyguard Hew (fearsome male gorilla companion) close. The two have found some success in Senghor, and are saving up to buy their first trading ship. In the Verduran Forest of Avistan, Gal (clever female centaur ranger) moves hoof in hoof with her boar companion Jinx (steadfast female boar companion), plunging tusk and arrow into the hearts of any would-be intruders. They are friendly with the local druids who reside on the Isle of Arenway, but aren’t beholden to their politics. In Alkenstar, the inventor Dr. Ashley Arrowbaud (distractable female human inventor) labored for years within her laboratory until she one day emerged with a large, arthropod-shaped metal creature marked SC- 04910 (sturdy genderless construct companion) who almost has a will of its own. The two have recently begun to discover the sinister actions of a secret society that includes members of the administration of Dr. Arrowbaud’s alma mater, Blythir College. Any of these characters may be, or may one day become, beast lords. By sharing a deep connection and the same goals, each pair may find a cause or quest that is important to them, which could eventually transform them into figures of legend. Tales of their exploits may inspire a similar connection in others, who might soon become another beast lord. You have forged your own union with a loyal companion. The two of you share every burden, every strife, and a clear destiny. That future, no matter what foes you face, lands you protect, or quests you pursue, always shares the commonality of your undying connection to each other. Though there will be enemies who seek to drive you apart or even send you into the hands of Pharasma, they will not be able to dissolve your partnership as long as you and your companion remain true to one another. You are one unit, one body and one mind, and the tribulations and trials set against you will quickly crumble through the power of your union. You need not travel alone, though others won’t truly understand the connection you have with one another. You and your companion may make other friends or even form intimate relationships outside of this bond. Those ties will always be secondary, however, and that may cause some jealousy or resentment. But nothing like that will ever drive a wedge between you and your companion. Those who shun or ostracize you for your bond will eventually see its power when you rise to become figures of myth whose stories will be told for the rest of eternity.

The pull of divinity can cause you to become disconnected from mortal concerns, but your hierophant is there to keep you grounded and connected to the mortal world. This will be the most essential and important of the relationships you develop as you pursue your adventures, for your hierophant serves as a reminder of where you have come from and acts as a critical ally in helping you become the god you seek to be. Most hierophants become the first high priest of a godling who achieves full divinity, and some may even become a herald or similarly powerful ally. \n\nThe opportunity to achieve many great deeds lies before you, along with the power to shape the world to your desires. Godhood is not promised, but you have the power to achieve it if you can overcome the challenges barring your path.

Stories abound that these “prophesied monarchs” will return when they’re needed, defying the barriers of time and death to ensure the safety of their people.

A ferocious pirate captain might treat her ship as her kingdom and her most loyal crewmates as her knights. A pious cleric might consider their church and parishioners their kingdom and the priests who serve alongside them as the knights sworn to protect the same.

It’s said that when the isles need them most, they shall awaken to usher in a new age.\n\nAny of these characters might be, or might one day become, prophesied monarchs, rulers whose legendary stories grow before them, establishing an immortal and incomparable dynasty that will long outlast their mortal life.\n\nWhatever self-made prophecy you might fulfill or kingdom you might rule is for you to decide. With your noble knights beside you, villains and monsters are sure to fall, and no hero will stay fallen long when their stalwart companions are close by to lift them to their feet.

However, his wild magic has recently attracted the attention of malevolent proteans from the Maelstrom, and he’ll need more allies than he currently has to keep his home safe from their unpredictable predations.\n\n**Ernhilda Truestone** (patient female dwarf sorcerer) used her wildspell powers to create an oasis of stable magic in the Mana Wastes, allowing her to give succor to harried travelers. Her home in the wastes grew to a bustling trading post, protected by her powers, though it rapidly faded after her passing. Some believe that Ernhilda’s spirit now resides in a cave somewhere under the settlement and that she could be brought back to life with the proper ritual. Finding the proper site for such magic has been hindered by the subterranean tunnels, which seem to shift randomly and without warning. \n\nTeachers at the Magaambya are concerned about a young student named **Mkosa** (curious nonbinary halfling student) who has begun to exhibit signs of being a nascent wildspell. They don’t wish to hinder Mkosa’s education but are afraid of accidental explosions of magic harming others. The teachers haven’t informed Mkosa about their worries, and the time to make a decision is rapidly approaching.\n\nPower and magic are yours to unleash, but only time will tell if you can master them to become a true wildspell. You’ll undergo trials of the spirit and body that have every chance of breaking you, either tearing your flesh apart with unfiltered magic or breaking your mind with arcane revelations about the Universe.

Ernhilda Truestone (patient female dwarf sorcerer) used her wildspell powers to create an oasis of stable magic in the Mana Wastes, allowing her to give succor to harried travelers. Her home in the wastes grew to a bustling trading post, protected by her powers, though it rapidly faded after her passing. Some believe that Ernhilda’s spirit now resides in a cave somewhere under the settlement and that she could be brought back to life with the proper ritual. Finding the proper site for such magic has been hindered by the subterranean tunnels, which seem to shift randomly and without warning. Teachers at the Magaambya are concerned about a young student named Mkosa (curious nonbinary halfling student) who has begun to exhibit signs of being a nascent wildspell. They don’t wish to hinder Mkosa’s education but are afraid of accidental explosions of magic harming others. The teachers haven’t informed Mkosa about their worries, and the time to make a decision is rapidly approaching. Power and magic are yours to unleash, but only time will tell if you can master them to become a true wildspell. You’ll undergo trials of the spirit and body that have every chance of breaking you, either tearing your flesh apart with unfiltered magic or breaking your mind with arcane revelations about the Universe. If you survive, your story will be one for the legends.

Though tales of Isthralei himself are scarce, his gifts are still sometimes given to those who protect travelers and collect their stories.\n\n This tradition of chronicling, relearned from the ghost of a Sarkorian storyteller, has flourished at the Academy of the Reclamation. Many students who enter the Sarkoris Scar now travel under Isthralei’s name, both believing in the god’s purpose and using his rediscovery as a symbol of the Reclamation’s successes. Even that may be too small a scope, however, as travelers’ tales come from far and wide. Many campfire chroniclers collect stories of other students who have returned to Sarkoris from afar, along with the stories of their families who were scattered following the opening of the Worldwound.\n\n The mysterious benefactor accepts all stories with a listening ear, leading to many late night discussions among students about what truths might be hidden in tall tales and outright fabrications. Although Isthralei accepts falsehoods without comment, he places no requirement on the chroniclers to do the same. In fact, Isthralei has yet to provide guidance beyond the comforting warmth of his protection after stories are offered.\n\nAlthough Sarkorian traditions don’t place importance on dividing their gods by power level or origin, some at the Academy of the Reclamation have begun to dig deeper into each of the gods’ individual circumstances. The question of where Isthralei came from has become a particularly popular one among students who hope that a god who so loves the stories of travelers wouldn’t take offense at his own story being exposed.\n\n Students prying into these matters have found some success using magical sources of information. Most recently, Cobyslarni’s Echo Repository has revealed several tales of travelers and explorers who encountered a smiling figure far from any habitation. The reoccurring theme of weary travelers being offered a space next to the campfire in exchange for their tales has led several students to suggest that the wanderer is actually Isthralei. Unfortunately, the sightings are so vastly spread—occurring between continents, in the First World of the fey, or even on elemental planes—that they’ve provided little illumination of the god’s origins.\n\n At the academy, Isthralei’s philosophy has expanded to include tenets to protect travelers’ freedom of movement, be generous to others when possible, and seek wisdom in the experience of others. Although these aren’t strictly necessary to gain or keep Isthralei’s favor, it’s difficult to find a teacher among the Academy of the Reclamation without agreeing to these tenets.\n\n This philosophy of protecting travelers is generally seen to include the Convocation’s guests in Nerosyan. Isthralei’s campfire chroniclers are among the most obvious representatives of their academy and the Convocation as a whole. Although surviving tales of the old god inspire campfire conversations on the exhibit grounds, his followers also listen to stories in bars, cafes, and the schools’ lodgings.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<title level=\"3\">Additional Feats</title>\r\n\r\nThis archetype has some feats at a level other than their original level.\r\nSuch feats are marked with a \\*.\r\n\r\n[Click here for the full rules on Additional Feats](/Rules.aspx?ID=1432).\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7438\" />\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7440\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7441\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7439\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7442\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7443\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4666\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7444\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7445\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7446\"\n\n/>","name":"Campfire Chronicler","pfs":"Standard","primary_source":"Rival Academies","primary_source_raw":"Rival Academies pg. 34","primary_source_category":"Lost Omens","primary_source_group":"Convocation","rarity":"uncommon","rarity_id":2,"release_date":"2025-02-26","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<spoilers>May contain spoilers from Convocation</spoilers>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=721\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Rival Academies](/Sources.aspx?ID=235) pg. 34\n\n**Archetype Category**\r\nMystical\r\n\r\n**Number of Feats** 10\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nYou follow in the footsteps of Isthralei, an old god of Sarkoris dedicated to protecting and assisting travelers in return for a story of their …\r\n</summary>","skill_mod":{},"source":["Rival Academies"],"source_raw":["Rival Academies pg. 34"],"source_category":["Lost Omens"],"source_group":["Convocation"],"source_markdown":"[Rival Academies](/Sources.aspx?ID=235) pg. 34","speed":{},"spoilers":"Convocation","summary":"You follow in the footsteps of Isthralei, an old god of Sarkoris dedicated to protecting and assisting travelers in return for a story of their …","summary_markdown":"You follow in the footsteps of Isthralei, an old god of Sarkoris dedicated to protecting and assisting travelers in return for a story of their …","text":" Campfire Chronicler May contain spoilers from Convocation Source Rival Academies pg. 34 You follow in the footsteps of Isthralei, an old god of Sarkoris dedicated to protecting and assisting travelers in return for a story of their journey.

Built for the battlefield and used to working alongside other warriors, as well as tackling dangerous solo operations, battle harbingers typically spend more time training outside their temples than praying within them. What they lack in spellcasting prowess they make up for with expertise in weaponry and defense.\n\n Even less combat-oriented faiths understand that battle harbingers can be a necessity, especially if there's a dangerous quest that must be undertaken alone. Because battle harbingers rigorously train their bodies to withstand hardship, they tend to have more capability to support themselves, leaving more traditional priests to handle group-wide supportive magic and prayers. Battle harbingers specialize in bolstering themselves with their deity's power and weakening their opponents in the same vein.\n\n A battle harbinger's training varies greatly from that of a typical cleric. While this training initially resembles that of a warpriest cleric, the martial and spellcasting philosophies of a battle harbinger soon differ. A battle harbinger is taught to rely less on their spells, instead focusing on a select array of spells to supplement their combat abilities. Their main magical abilities focus on battle auras, spells that create areas centered on the battle harbinger that either empower their allies or hamper their foes. Battle harbingers are generally expected to take the fight directly to a foe, and their auras supplement these tactics. The main component of a battle harbinger's training involves their battle creed. While a battle creed varies from faith to faith, the core aspects of these creeds remain the same regardless of dogma. A battle creed declares a battle harbinger to be a living weapon for their god or faith. The battle harbinger is expected to enter combat on behalf of their god and to adhere to strict training regimens that support this goal. Battle harbingers train to make use of powerful armor and their god's favored weapon. Supplemental training focuses on the body, allowing battle harbingers to stave off fatigue and dangers that target one's health directly. Some battle harbingers, such as those who follow Erastil, prefer to make use of ranged tactics, but they still learn more direct combat should the need arise.\n\n Although a battle harbinger's spellcasting capabilities are more limited than their fellow clerics, their magic generally isn't less potent. Battle harbingers are still capable of calling down strong divine power, but they rely on this magic less often than their brethren. This is mostly due to their martial training, which focuses on their bodies, combat, and defense. As such, a battle harbinger doesn't carry as much magic potential as other clerics. The exception to this is their training in battle auras, which many battle harbingers are able to make greater use of as their prowess grows.\n\n While most battle harbingers are associated with a given temple, it's not unusual for one to be a lone mercenary, enacting their deity's will along their travels and through their contract work.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Battle Creed</title>\r\n\r\nYou've undergone a special training to focus your body toward combat. While you still adhere to the teachings of your faith, you also know that you serve as an instrument of your church. More so than any warpriest, the physical rigors that come with battle are key to your training. You've dedicated yourself to the battle creed, a specific approach that puts combat prowess first, even at the expense of a cleric's typical spellcasting and restorative abilities. Defeating one's enemies is more important than healing an ally in the heat of battle; the time for healing comes after. As you abide by the battle creed, your physical and martial capabilities grow stronger. You must select Battle Herald Dedication as your 2nd- level class feat.\n\n **Prerequisites:** You must be a [cleric](/Classes.aspx?ID=33).<br /> You don't gain the Resolute Faith class feature.<br /> You don't gain the Miraculous Spell class feature.\n\n **Spellcasting Adjustment:** Your spellcasting capabilities are more restricted. At 1st level, you can prepare one 1st-rank spell and five cantrips. As you increase in level, your number of spell slots and the highest rank of spells you can cast from spell slots increases, shown in Battle Harbinger Spells per Day. Because of your focus on your physical training at the expense of magical aptitude, you have no more than two spell slots of your highest rank and, if you can cast 2nd-rank spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 rank lower than your highest spell rank. For anything that requires the ability to cast spells of a certain rank that's lower than the highest slots you have, you still qualify even if you no longer have spell slots at those ranks.\n\n **Divine Font Adjustment:** Instead of preparing [_heal_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1554) or [_harm_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1552) spells with your divine font, you instead gain the battle font, which allows you to prepare battle aura spells. You gain 4 additional spell slots each day at your highest rank of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only [_bane_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1447) or [_bless_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1451) in these slots. Any feats and effects that refer to a battle aura refers to these spells, regardless of whether they were cast with your standard spell slots or your divine font spell slots. At 5th level, the number of additional slots increases to 5, and at 15th level, the total number of additional slots increases to 6. Your battle auras use your class DC instead of your spell DC.\n\n **Doctrine Adjustment:** Instead of choosing a doctrine, you follow the battle creed. At 1st level, you gain the benefits of the initial creed. You gain additional benefits from your creed at the listed levels.\n\n _Initial Creed (1st):_ You're trained in light and medium armor, and you have expert proficiency in Fortitude saves. You're trained in martial weapons. If your deity's favored weapon is a simple weapon or an unarmed attack, you gain the [Deadly Simplicity](/Feats.aspx?ID=4642) cleric feat. At 13th level when you gain the Divine Defense class feature, you also gain expert proficiency in light and medium armor.\n\n _Lesser Creed (5th):_ You gain expert proficiency with your deity's favored weapon, martial weapons, simple weapons, and unarmed attacks. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using your deity's favored weapon, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect. Your proficiency rank for your class DC increases to expert.\n\n _Moderate Creed (9th):_ You gain [Reactive Strike](/Feats.aspx?ID=5832) as a cleric feat.\n\n _Greater Creed (11th):_ Your proficiency ranks for the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics increase to expert.\n\n_Major Creed (13th):_ You gain master proficiency with your deity's favored weapon. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.\n\n _True Creed (15th):_ Your proficiency rank for your class DC increases to master. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master.\n\n _Final Creed (19th):_ Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmed defense, increase to master. Your proficiency rank for your class DC increases to legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Battle Harbinger Spells Per Day</title>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"inner spells-per-day\" style=\"float:left; clear:left; margin:10px 10px 10px 0px; overflow:hidden\"> <tr><td>**Your Level**</td><td>**Cantrips**</td><td>**1**</td><td>**2**</td><td>**3**</td><td>**4**</td><td>**5**</td><td>**6**</td><td>**7**</td><td>**8**</td><td>**9**</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr> <tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr> <tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr> <tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr> <tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr> </table> \n\n<title level=\"3\">Additional Feats</title>\r\n\r\nThis archetype has some feats at a level other than their original level.\r\nSuch feats are marked with a \\*.\r\n\r\n[Click here for the full rules on Additional Feats](/Rules.aspx?ID=1432).\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7505\" />\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4775\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 2*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7506\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4782\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 4*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7507\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-5028\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 6*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7508\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7509\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7510\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7511\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7512\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7513\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7514\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7515\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7516\"\n\n/>","name":"Battle Harbinger","pfs":"Standard","prerequisite":"battle creed","prerequisite_markdown":"[battle creed](/Doctrines.aspx?ID=6)","primary_source":"Divine Mysteries","primary_source_raw":"Divine Mysteries pg. 272","primary_source_category":"Lost Omens","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2025-01-30","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Divine Mysteries](/Sources.aspx?ID=234) pg. 272\r\n\r\n**Prerequisites**\r\n[battle creed](/Doctrines.aspx?ID=6)\n\n**Archetype Categories**\r\nClass, Multiclass\r\n\r\n**Number of Feats** 15\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nBattle harbingers are elite, specially trained members of their faith, usually carrying out missions that require extra martial prowess.

You have placed service to the Living God above all other duties and entrusted your wealth, prosperity, and ambitions to his teachings, while availing yourself of the knowledge and wisdom that only his most blessed servants are ever bestowed with, accepting the power and authority that is the right of the Living God's priests. Perhaps this is a pure zealousness, or perhaps you are motivated by Razmir's promises of wealth and authority. Either way, you have donned the mask and wield the power reserved for those who follow in Razmir's footsteps. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7567\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7568\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7569\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7570\" />","trait":["Uncommon"],"trait_group":["Rarity"],"trait_markdown":"[Uncommon](/Traits.aspx?ID=159)","trait_raw":["Uncommon"],"type":"Archetype","url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=307","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"archetype-308","_score":4.88543,"_source":{"access":"Followers of Rivethun have access to this feat.","archetype":["Rivethun Emissary"],"archetype_category":["Mystical"],"category":"archetype","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"archetype-308","level":2,"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Archetype 2\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Rivethun Emissary](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=308)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\n\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n</traits>\n\n**Source** [Divine Mysteries](/Sources.aspx?ID=234) pg. 292\r\n\r\n_[**PFS Note**](/pathfinder-society) Rivethun is a philosophy which characters may choose as their religion.

With the proper training, an explorer can perceive these currents, sensing cues carried on them like airborne scents. With further work, they can drift with these energies like a leaf on a river, or even hide themselves in the primal eddies to evade their foes’ senses.

Losing Control The process for animating objects varies from object to object and by the needs of the ritual. Some rituals designate a controller whom the animated object obeys. Without orders, many animated objects fall back to defensive tactics. In other cases, the ritual may have been poorly performed or may have failed after many years, causing the animated object to enter an uncontrollable state where it attacks anything it sees.

Born of supernatural creatures who kill and consume the child’s father, changelings are deposited into their father’s society to be raised. These offspring appear to be members of their paternal ancestry, and changelings have been found among dwarves, gnomes, orcs, goblins, and numerous others, but human-ancestry changelings are by far the most common. Within the normal range for their ancestry, changelings tend toward slighter builds, darker hair, and pale complexions, though their most common feature is a nearly universal heterochromia, leading to widespread superstition about individuals with differently colored eyes.\n\n As changelings come of age, they sometimes manifest abilities granted by their hag heritage.

Svirfneblins, as deep gnomes call themselves, have skin the color of gray or brown stone. While deep gnome males are bald, women have thin, pale-gray hair, and all have the large, expressive eyes typical among all gnomes. A deep gnome is 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 65 pounds. Deep gnomes rarely interact with those outside of their small cavern communities, and they are slow to trust outsiders, sometimes keeping them imprisoned for years simply to prevent them from informing others of the deep gnome settlement.\n\n The first deep gnomes rose in the underground world some time after their early gnome ancestors migrated from the First World to Golarion. A group of these migrants elected to settle underground instead of on the surface, and it was from these gnomes that the svirfneblin came to be. Some believe the gnomes chose the Darklands as their home to watch for and stop any evil fey who might infiltrate the underground region, but much like the exact reasons for the gnomes' relocation, their motivation has been lost to time. Thousands of years of living in subterranean caverns with little to no light transformed the physical characteristics of the gnomes living there into those of the deep gnome of today.\n\n Though deep gnomes may seem dour and recalcitrant at first glance, they retain the fey blood of their ancestors. In fact, deep gnomes are sometimes more emotionally erratic than their gnome cousins, lashing out violently at what seems like the smallest provocation. Such an explosion is often followed by an extended period of quiet brooding. Despite this, deep gnome communities are close-knit, as each citizen knows when to give the others the space they require to process their feelings.\n\n Many deep gnome settlements have clashed with nearby [duergar](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=38) communities for myriad reasons: resources, territory, and even religion and morality. Over the centuries, some of these disputes have evolved into full wars, with many lives lost on both sides. Neither deep gnomes nor duergars are particularly proud of these conflicts, but both insist they were in the right each time. The ferocity with which most duergars fight has left a deep impression on the psyches of some deep gnome communities, leading them to distrust all dwarves and dwarf-like ancestries even more than other strangers.

Svirfneblins, as deep gnomes call themselves, have skin the color of gray or brown stone. While deep gnome males are bald, women have thin, pale-gray hair, and all have the large, expressive eyes typical among all gnomes. A deep gnome is 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 65 pounds. Deep gnomes rarely interact with those outside of their small cavern communities, and they are slow to trust outsiders, sometimes keeping them imprisoned for years simply to prevent them from informing others of the deep gnome settlement. The first deep gnomes rose in the underground world some time after their early gnome ancestors migrated from the First World to Golarion. A group of these migrants elected to settle underground instead of on the surface, and it was from these gnomes that the svirfneblin came to be. Some believe the gnomes chose the Darklands as their home to watch for and stop any evil fey who might infiltrate the underground region, but much like the exact reasons for the gnomes' relocation, their motivation has been lost to time. Thousands of years of living in subterranean caverns with little to no light transformed the physical characteristics of the gnomes living there into those of the deep gnome of today. Though deep gnomes may seem dour and recalcitrant at first glance, they retain the fey blood of their ancestors. In fact, deep gnomes are sometimes more emotionally erratic than their gnome cousins, lashing out violently at what seems like the smallest provocation. Such an explosion is often followed by an extended period of quiet brooding. Despite this, deep gnome communities are close-knit, as each citizen knows when to give the others the space they require to process their feelings. Many deep gnome settlements have clashed with nearby duergar communities for myriad reasons: resources, territory, and even religion and morality. Over the centuries, some of these disputes have evolved into full wars, with many lives lost on both sides.

Typically infused with magic that allows for jungles to grow deep underground (and sometimes even sunlike orbs that illuminate the lands from above, simulating a day‑night cycle), areas such as Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect places for dinosaurs to roam. Magical Dinosaurs In a fantasy setting, magical effects or supernatural influences can enhance dinosaurs by giving them unexpected attacks, modes of movement, or other abilities. You can quickly create a memorable magical beast simply by giving a dinosaur the magical attack of another creature of an equal level, such as a spinosaurus gaining an acidic breath weapon akin to that of an adult black dragon. Other Dinosaurs A wide range of dinosaurs are presented on these pages, but any trip to the movies, exploration of dinosaur books, or a quick online search reveals a wealth of additional creatures that could fit into your game as well. Armor-headed pachycephalosaurs, spike-thumbed iguanodons, duck-billed hadrosaurs, sail-backed spinosauruses, and more await discovery by those who would seek out the mysteries of the lost worlds where the thunder lizards still rule! Primeval Lands Dinosaurs fit well into certain types of settings. They’re often found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus—regions known as lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.

For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Drake Eggs</title> While drake hides aren’t any more valuable than those of other, similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. While they are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.\n\n A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.\n\n A drake egg has Hardness 3, 5 HP, and BT 5. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.\n\n Once a drake hatches, it imprints on the first creature that it sees. A creature imprinted on in this way gains a +5 bonus to Nature checks to train or command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the region, the type of drake, and the exact purpose the buyer has in mind, but typically depends on the level of the drake. Because drakes are evil, dangerous, and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.\n\n It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges due to cruelty, overconfidence, or general lack of skill.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Desert Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=164) (Creature 8), [Flame Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=160) (Creature 5), [Frost Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=163) (Creature 7), [Jungle Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=161) (Creature 6), [Prairie Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1928) (Creature 2), [River Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=159) (Creature 3), [Sea Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=641) (Creature 6), [Shadow Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=640) (Creature 2), [Wyvern](/Monsters.aspx?ID=162) (Creature 6)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Drake Ecology</title>\r\n\r\nDrakes reach maturity and reproduce much earlier than dragons, meaning that they are a far more common threat than their more powerful forebears.

Elemental Vortexes Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms. Looting Earth Elementals Earth elementals sometimes have valuable gemstones or minerals incorporated into their bodies, and once they are slain, these valuables can be scavenged as treasure. Gemstones, precious metals such as silver or gold ore, or rarer materials such as mithral or adamantine can be harvested from these creatures, although the more expensive finds tend to be incorporated into only the most powerful earth elementals. Monstrous Elementals Some elementals are more than living incarnations of air, earth, fire, or water. Creatures like the genie, the uthul, or the zaramuun have their own complex ecologies and societies. While these creatures originally hail from an Elemental Plane, they can often be found on the Material Plane as well. Other Elementals When energies from elemental planes mix, unusual elemental life can form. The combination of fire and earth, for example, can spawn magma elementals, while air and water can create ice elementals. Lightning elementals form from a conjunction of fire and air, while water and earth give birth to mud elementals. It’s possible that in the vastness of the Great Beyond, even more unusual elementals might exist, although they are as rare as they are strange. Primal Elementals The most well known of all elementals are the primal elementals, creatures composed entirely of air, earth, fire, or water with roughly humanoid shapes. Many primal elementals are named after natural disasters, ranging from those relatively small in scale (and roughly the size of Medium humanoids) to much larger ones (often the size of small buildings). Primal elementals can often be found in areas where their namesake disasters have recently struck.

These creatures are often found in larger settlements or living alongside genies on their respective planes. Diverse Elementals The Elemental Planes are more than expanses of sky, rock, fire, and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and storms float through the Plane of Air. The Plane of Earth includes verdant groves, shining metal and crystal, and irradiated wastelands. The Plane of Fire features magma, suffocating smoke, and radiant firelight. Amid the endless sea of the Plane of Water are pockets of ooze and brine, plus the otherworldly environs of the deep. Elemental Beings The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts. The elementals on these pages exemplify the creatures of the Elemental Planes, but this list is by no means exhaustive. Elemental Creatures Not all elementals are lumbering, humanoid-shaped creatures. Some take on the forms and natures of animals and beasts from the Material Plane. These creatures often behave in ways similar to their Material Plane counterparts, even though as elementals they lack the animalistic instincts mortal creatures have when it comes to hunting, reproducing, and the like. Elemental creatures are favorites of conjurers due to their small size, relative ease of summoning, and varied abilities. Elemental Lords The most powerful elementals are demigods known as elemental lords. Until recently, only four evil elemental lords ruled over realms on the Elemental Planes. However, recent events have allowed the previously imprisoned good elemental lords to return to their realms, causing massive conflicts that could lead to planar wars. Elemental Vortexes Where the boundary between planes wears thin, elementals manifest in the world through churning vortexes. Such gateways might lie at the heart of a volcano, a deep ocean trench, in regions beset with earthquakes, or within great storms. Flame and Fathom Meet Though fire and water classically oppose one another, in the right mixture they can become a dangerous combination.

As they are remnants of a past life and retain their intelligence, ghosts can convey long-lost information or serve as a way to inform the PCs of crucial story elements. In this way, a ghost in an adventure can provide a clue or even a complete history of a site or event. Unlike most other undead, ghosts can retain the alignment they had in life, but regardless they should remain tragic and frightening figures in play.\r\n</aside>\n\n<title level=\"2\">Creating a Ghost</title>\r\n\r\nWhile it's best to create custom ghosts to fill an adventure's specific needs, you can also use the following guidelines to turn existing living creatures into ghosts.<br /> First, increase the creature's level by 2 and change its statistics as follows. \n<ul><li>Increase AC, saves, Perception, DCs, and skill modifiers by 2. Increase the most appropriate melee attack modifier by 4 to become ghostly hand (described below), and other attack modifiers by 2.</li> <li>A ghost has a Strength modifier of –5 and a Constitution modifier of +0.</li> <li>Do not modify the ghost's Hit Points due to its new level.</li></ul> \n\n<title level=\"3\">Ghost Abilities</title> A ghost gains the incorporeal, spirit, and undead traits. Many become evil. If the base creature has any abilities or traits that come from it being a living, corporeal creature, it loses them. You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghost. All ghosts gain the following abilities. <br />**[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)**<br /> **Site Bound** A typical ghost can stray only a short distance from where it was killed or the place it haunts. A typical limit is 120 feet. Some ghosts are instead bound to a room, building, item, or creature that was special to it rather than a location.<br /> **[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)**<br /> **Rejuvenation** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) When a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone determines the reason for its existence and sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting.<br /> **Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)<br /> **Resistances** all damage 5 (except [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=75), [ghost touch](/Equipment.aspx?ID=297), or [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128); double resistance to non-[magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103)). This resistance increases to 10 at 9th level and 15 at 16th level.<br /> **Fly Speed** equal to its Speed<br /> **Ghostly Hand** All ghosts have a ghostly hand unarmed attack that deals negative damage. It typically has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170), [finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179), and [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103) traits. Some ghosts wield ghostly memories of weapons they held in life, but the effect is the same. \n\n<title level=\"3\">Special Abilities</title> Select one or two of the following abilities, or potentially three if the ghost is 9th level or higher. These abilities should relate to the ghost's death or its history. You can also create new abilities or adapt those from monsters or classes to fit the theme. For DCs, use 2 + the DC of the ghost's level.<br /> **Corrupting Gaze** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> The ghost stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target takes 1d6 negative damage + 1d6 per 2 levels with a basic Will save. A creature that fails its save is also [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) for 1 minute.<br /> **Draining Touch** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> With a touch, the ghost attempts to drain a living creature's life force. It makes a ghostly hand Strike but deals no damage on a hit. Instead, the target becomes [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) for 1 day, and the ghost regains HP equal to half its own level.<br /> **Frightful Moan** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) The ghost laments its fate, forcing each living creature within 30 feet to attempt a Will save. On a failure, a creature becomes [frightened 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19) (or frightened 3 on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghost's frightful moan for 1 minute.<br /> **Inhabit Object** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> The ghost possesses an object of size Large or smaller within 20 feet, making it an [animated object](/Rituals.aspx?ID=1). This animated object's level can be no higher than the ghost's level – 2. If the target object is being held by a creature, the bearer can attempt a Will save to prevent the possession. This possession ends when the object is destroyed or the ghost leaves it. At this point, the ghost reappears in the object's square and can't Inhabit an Object again for 1d4 rounds.<br /> **Malevolent Possession** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> The ghost attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the [possession](/Spells.aspx?ID=225) spell, except since the ghost doesn't have a physical body, it is unaffected by that restriction of the spell.<br /> **Telekinetic Assault** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65)) The ghost cries out in pain and anguish as small objects and debris fly about in a 30-foot emanation. Creatures in this area take 1d6 bludgeoning damage + 1d6 per 2 levels, subject to a basic Reflex save. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Special Abilities</title>**Source** [_Pathfinder #165: Eyes of Empty Death pg. 69_](https://paizo.com/products/btq024xm)<br /> Ghosts can select from the following special abilities in addition to those listed in the _Bestiary_. Of special note, several of abilities invoke the ghost's particular circumstances and death and can be used to guide heroes toward new avenues of investigation—possibly in exchange for a good share of their Hit Points. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Beatific Appearance</title> When dealing with ghosts, appearances can be deceiving. For every gory specter exists an innocent-looking spirit, their cherubic mien enhanced with magic to lull victims to their deaths. \n\n**Beatific Appearance** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61)) **Requirements** A creature the ghost is aware of targets the ghost with an attack; **Effect** The ghost has an unusually pitiable appearance or can change its features to look like someone close to the attacker, which causes the target to pull back on its attack. The triggering creature must attempt a Will save. On a failure, the creature takes a –1 circumstance penalty to its attack roll (–2 on a critical failure). \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Cold Spot</title> Ghosts are often associated with unnatural cold, and one of the first signs of a ghostly presence is an uncanny cold spot in the air. \n\n**Cold Spot** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48)) The air within 5 feet of the ghost is supernaturally cold. Characters that enter or begin their turn in the ghost's aura take 1d6 cold damage per 3 levels the ghost has ([basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Fortitude save). \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Corporeal Manifestation</title> Traditionally, ghosts are thought of as wispy, insubstantial things, but not all ghosts follow this rule. \n\n**Corporeal Manifestation** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32)) The ghost loses the [incorporeal](/Traits.aspx?ID=222) trait, temporarily increasing its Strength modifier to equal its Charisma modifier. The ghost loses its immunity to precision damage and its resistance to all damage while corporeal. The ghost can resume being incorporeal by using this action again. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Dreamwalker</title> People who encounter ghosts are often plagued by nightmares, sometimes supernatural ones. Only powerful ghosts of 6th level or higher have this ability. \n\n**Dreamwalker** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [illusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=92), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) Anyone who meets the ghost or visits its bound site can become subject to this effect. The first time the subject sleeps after their ghostly encounter, they're targeted by a [_nightmare_](/Spells.aspx?ID=208) spell, with the nightmares being somehow related to the ghost. Most often this means that the subject relives the ghost's last moments alive, but there are other possibilities. If the ghost wishes, it can manipulate the dreams to send messages or even hold entire conversations with dreamers. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Fade</title> Ghosts are notorious for appearing and disappearing when least expected. \n\n**Fade** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [illusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=92)) The ghost becomes [invisible](/Conditions.aspx?ID=26) until the beginning of its next turn. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Fetch</title> A fetch is a person's double, often associated with hauntings and considered a mark of great ill omen. \n\n**Fetch** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [illusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=92)) The ghost creates an illusory double of a creature. The fetch functions as a 2nd-level [_illusory creature_](/Spells.aspx?ID=158), except that the ghost doesn't control the fetch, and the spell lasts for 1d4 hours instead of needing to Sustain the Spell. The fetch has a rudimentary intelligence and tries to imitate its original (it has a [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) skill value equal to the ghost's highest skill) but comes across as confused or vague. A ghost can have only one fetch at a time. If the creature doubled by the fetch encounters it, the creature must succeed at a Will save or become [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) (stupefied 2 on a Critical Failure) for as long as they can see the fetch. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Ghost Storm</title> Most ghosts can summon a wind to rattle a window or bang a shutter, but some angry spirits can do far worse. \n\n**Ghost Storm** ([air](/Traits.aspx?ID=5), [aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65)) Wind surrounds the ghost out to a range of 30 feet. The wind extinguishes small non-magical fires, disperses fog and mist, blows objects of light Bulk or less around, and pushes larger objects. Squares in the ghost's aura are difficult terrain and flying creatures are always considered to be [moving against the wind](/Rules.aspx?ID=400). The ghost can dismiss or resume the wind as an action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Haunted House</title> Ghosts tend to haunt a specific place, remaining for eternity within a tightly bound space. They might haunt their graves or the sites of their death, but either way they rarely venture far. In their home, though, a ghost holds great power. \n\n**Haunted House** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> **Frequency** once every 10 minutes; **Effect** The ghost extends its presence throughout its bound site until the end of its next turn. Within this area, the ghost can extend its senses, gaining the benefits of [all-around vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=1), and can make ghostly hand attacks or use special abilities originating from any part of the area. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Lynchpin</title> Ghosts are typically thought of as solitary beings, but sometimes their will and rage are so strong that they drag others back from the grave as well. \n\n**Lynchpin** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) The ghost extends some of its nature to one or more [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) of equal or lower level, who are connected to the ghost's story and unfinished business. These undead gain the ghost's Rejuvenation ability and can't be permanently destroyed so long as the ghost exists. If the ghost is laid to rest, all linked undead are likewise instantly destroyed. Linked undead  often, but not always, share the ghost's Site-Bound ability as well. The ghost doesn't have any control over such undead, and indeed the ghost and their partners in eternity may be unremittingly hostile to one another. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Memento Mori</title> For most ghosts, death is a traumatic event, and an angry spirit is perfectly willing to share their pain with others. \n\n**Memento Mori** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [illusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=92), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) The ghost causes one creature within 30 feet to relive the ghost's death. The target must succeed at a Will save or see and feel what the ghost did, taking 1d4 [persistent mental damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) per 2 levels the ghost has. All other creatures are [concealed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=4) to the target until the persistent damage ends. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Phanstamagoria</title> Ghost are rarely aware of the passage of time and see no difference between the homes they lived in long ago and the ruins they haunt now. Some ghosts can spread that delusion to others. \n\n**Phantasmagoria** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [illusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=92), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [olfactory](/Traits.aspx?ID=246), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) The ghost causes all or part of its bound site to look, sound, feel, and smell like a different kind of place, and can populate it with simple illusions of people or animals. Typically, the ghost can recreate only a handful of images, usually different versions of its bound site as it appeared during the ghost's life. This can't disguise any creatures in the area, though it can cause minor, cosmetic changes (like causing a creature's clothing to appear nicer for a party or bloodstained for a battle). Any creature that touches the illusion or uses the [Seek](/Actions.aspx?ID=84) action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve it. Creatures can't leave the area of the illusion until they successfully disbelieve it. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Pyre's Memory</title> Burning is one of the most painful ways to die, and ghosts that burned to death are often more aggressive and violent than other incorporeal creatures. Their bound site is often scorched or scarred with some other evidence of fire. \n\n**Pyre's Memory** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72)) The ghost causes great gouts of flame to erupt without warning. The ghost picks three 5-foot squares within 30 feet. Creatures that start in or enter one of these squares take 1d6 fire damage per 2 levels the ghost has, subject to a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save. The flames last for 1 minute and don't set other things alight unless the ghost wishes. If the ghost uses this ability again, it dismisses any existing flames. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Revenant</title> Not all ghosts try to possess the living. Some prefer to ride corpses instead, wrenching bodies from shallow graves to serve as their hosts. \n\n**Revenant** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> or 1 hour; **Effect** The ghost possesses and transforms an adjacent corpse (this requires 2 actions if the ghost is possessing its own corpse; otherwise, it takes an hour). The possessed corpse uses the statistics of a non-[incorporeal](/Traits.aspx?ID=222) [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) 2 levels lower than the ghost, and the ghost possesses it as if using the [_possession_](/Spells.aspx?ID=225) spell. The specific undead is determined by the nature of the ghost and the corpse—[ghoul](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=52), [wights](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=163), and [dullahans](/Monsters.aspx?ID=171) are all common, but almost any undead is possible. If the ghost ceases to possess the corpse, the corporeal undead is immediately destroyed.","name":"Ghost","primary_source":"Bestiary","primary_source_raw":"Bestiary pg. 166","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2019-08-01","remaster_id":["creature-family-418"],"resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 166\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nWhen some mortals die through tragic circumstances or without closure, they can linger on in the world.

Building Ghosts Note that the ghost mage is built from the ground up, rather than by applying the ghost rules to a once-living creature, so its numbers don’t exactly match the values listed above. This is usually the better way to go if you have the time, as it allows you to hand-craft a ghost for the situation. Custom Ghosts Ghosts work best in adventures when used sparingly. As they are remnants of a past life and retain their intelligence, ghosts can convey long-lost information or serve as a way to inform the PCs of crucial story elements. In this way, a ghost in an adventure can provide a clue or even a complete history of a site or event. Unlike most other undead, ghosts can retain the alignment they had in life, but regardless they should remain tragic and frightening figures in play. Creating a Ghost While it's best to create custom ghosts to fill an adventure's specific needs, you can also use the following guidelines to turn existing living creatures into ghosts. First, increase the creature's level by 2 and change its statistics as follows. Increase AC, saves, Perception, DCs, and skill modifiers by 2. Increase the most appropriate melee attack modifier by 4 to become ghostly hand (described below), and other attack modifiers by 2. A ghost has a Strength modifier of –5 and a Constitution modifier of +0. Do not modify the ghost's Hit Points due to its new level. Ghost Abilities A ghost gains the incorporeal, spirit, and undead traits. Many become evil. If the base creature has any abilities or traits that come from it being a living, corporeal creature, it loses them. You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghost. All ghosts gain the following abilities. Darkvision Site Bound A typical ghost can stray only a short distance from where it was killed or the place it haunts. A typical limit is 120 feet. Some ghosts are instead bound to a room, building, item, or creature that was special to it rather than a location. Negative Healing Rejuvenation (divine, necromancy) When a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone determines the reason for its existence and sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting. Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious Resistances all damage 5 (except force, ghost touch, or positive; double resistance to non-magical). This resistance increases to 10 at 9th level and 15 at 16th level. Fly Speed equal to its Speed Ghostly Hand All ghosts have a ghostly hand unarmed attack that deals negative damage. It typically has the agile, finesse, and magical traits. Some ghosts wield ghostly memories of weapons they held in life, but the effect is the same. Special Abilities Select one or two of the following abilities, or potentially three if the ghost is 9th level or higher. These abilities should relate to the ghost's death or its history. You can also create new abilities or adapt those from monsters or classes to fit the theme. For DCs, use 2 + the DC of the ghost's level. Corrupting Gaze Two Actions The ghost stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target takes 1d6 negative damage + 1d6 per 2 levels with a basic Will save. A creature that fails its save is also stupefied 1 for 1 minute. Draining Touch Two Actions With a touch, the ghost attempts to drain a living creature's life force. It makes a ghostly hand Strike but deals no damage on a hit. Instead, the target becomes drained 1 for 1 day, and the ghost regains HP equal to half its own level. Frightful Moan Two Actions (auditory, divine, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) The ghost laments its fate, forcing each living creature within 30 feet to attempt a Will save. On a failure, a creature becomes frightened 2 (or frightened 3 on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghost's frightful moan for 1 minute. Inhabit Object Single Action The ghost possesses an object of size Large or smaller within 20 feet, making it an animated object. This animated object's level can be no higher than the ghost's level – 2. If the target object is being held by a creature, the bearer can attempt a Will save to prevent the possession. This possession ends when the object is destroyed or the ghost leaves it. At this point, the ghost reappears in the object's square and can't Inhabit an Object again for 1d4 rounds. Malevolent Possession Two Actions The ghost attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the possession spell, except since the ghost doesn't have a physical body, it is unaffected by that restriction of the spell. Telekinetic Assault Two Actions (divine, evocation) The ghost cries out in pain and anguish as small objects and debris fly about in a 30-foot emanation. Creatures in this area take 1d6 bludgeoning damage + 1d6 per 2 levels, subject to a basic Reflex save. Special Abilities Source Pathfinder #165: Eyes of Empty Death pg. 69 Ghosts can select from the following special abilities in addition to those listed in the Bestiary . Of special note, several of abilities invoke the ghost's particular circumstances and death and can be used to guide heroes toward new avenues of investigation—possibly in exchange for a good share of their Hit Points. Beatific Appearance When dealing with ghosts, appearances can be deceiving. For every gory specter exists an innocent-looking spirit, their cherubic mien enhanced with magic to lull victims to their deaths. Beatific Appearance Reaction (divine, enchantment) Requirements A creature the ghost is aware of targets the ghost with an attack; Effect The ghost has an unusually pitiable appearance or can change its features to look like someone close to the attacker, which causes the target to pull back on its attack. The triggering creature must attempt a Will save. On a failure, the creature takes a –1 circumstance penalty to its attack roll (–2 on a critical failure). Cold Spot Ghosts are often associated with unnatural cold, and one of the first signs of a ghostly presence is an uncanny cold spot in the air. Cold Spot (aura, cold, divine) The air within 5 feet of the ghost is supernaturally cold. Characters that enter or begin their turn in the ghost's aura take 1d6 cold damage per 3 levels the ghost has (basic Fortitude save). Corporeal Manifestation Traditionally, ghosts are thought of as wispy, insubstantial things, but not all ghosts follow this rule. Corporeal Manifestation Single Action (concentrate) The ghost loses the incorporeal trait, temporarily increasing its Strength modifier to equal its Charisma modifier. The ghost loses its immunity to precision damage and its resistance to all damage while corporeal. The ghost can resume being incorporeal by using this action again. Dreamwalker People who encounter ghosts are often plagued by nightmares, sometimes supernatural ones. Only powerful ghosts of 6th level or higher have this ability. Dreamwalker (divine, illusion, mental) Anyone who meets the ghost or visits its bound site can become subject to this effect. The first time the subject sleeps after their ghostly encounter, they're targeted by a nightmare spell, with the nightmares being somehow related to the ghost. Most often this means that the subject relives the ghost's last moments alive, but there are other possibilities. If the ghost wishes, it can manipulate the dreams to send messages or even hold entire conversations with dreamers. Fade Ghosts are notorious for appearing and disappearing when least expected. Fade Single Action (divine, illusion) The ghost becomes invisible until the beginning of its next turn. Fetch A fetch is a person's double, often associated with hauntings and considered a mark of great ill omen. Fetch Two Actions (divine, illusion) The ghost creates an illusory double of a creature. The fetch functions as a 2nd-level illusory creature , except that the ghost doesn't control the fetch, and the spell lasts for 1d4 hours instead of needing to Sustain the Spell. The fetch has a rudimentary intelligence and tries to imitate its original (it has a Deception skill value equal to the ghost's highest skill) but comes across as confused or vague. A ghost can have only one fetch at a time. If the creature doubled by the fetch encounters it, the creature must succeed at a Will save or become stupefied 1 (stupefied 2 on a Critical Failure) for as long as they can see the fetch. Ghost Storm Most ghosts can summon a wind to rattle a window or bang a shutter, but some angry spirits can do far worse. Ghost Storm (air, aura, divine, evocation) Wind surrounds the ghost out to a range of 30 feet. The wind extinguishes small non-magical fires, disperses fog and mist, blows objects of light Bulk or less around, and pushes larger objects. Squares in the ghost's aura are difficult terrain and flying creatures are always considered to be moving against the wind. The ghost can dismiss or resume the wind as an action, which has the concentrate trait. Haunted House Ghosts tend to haunt a specific place, remaining for eternity within a tightly bound space. They might haunt their graves or the sites of their death, but either way they rarely venture far. In their home, though, a ghost holds great power. Haunted House Single Action Frequency once every 10 minutes; Effect The ghost extends its presence throughout its bound site until the end of its next turn. Within this area, the ghost can extend its senses, gaining the benefits of all-around vision, and can make ghostly hand attacks or use special abilities originating from any part of the area. Lynchpin Ghosts are typically thought of as solitary beings, but sometimes their will and rage are so strong that they drag others back from the grave as well. Lynchpin (divine, necromancy) The ghost extends some of its nature to one or more undead of equal or lower level, who are connected to the ghost's story and unfinished business. These undead gain the ghost's Rejuvenation ability and can't be permanently destroyed so long as the ghost exists. If the ghost is laid to rest, all linked undead are likewise instantly destroyed. Linked undead often, but not always, share the ghost's Site-Bound ability as well. The ghost doesn't have any control over such undead, and indeed the ghost and their partners in eternity may be unremittingly hostile to one another. Memento Mori For most ghosts, death is a traumatic event, and an angry spirit is perfectly willing to share their pain with others. Memento Mori Two Actions (divine, illusion, mental) The ghost causes one creature within 30 feet to relive the ghost's death. The target must succeed at a Will save or see and feel what the ghost did, taking 1d4 persistent mental damage per 2 levels the ghost has. All other creatures are concealed to the target until the persistent damage ends. Phanstamagoria Ghost are rarely aware of the passage of time and see no difference between the homes they lived in long ago and the ruins they haunt now. Some ghosts can spread that delusion to others. Phantasmagoria Three Actions (auditory, divine, illusion, mental, olfactory, visual) The ghost causes all or part of its bound site to look, sound, feel, and smell like a different kind of place, and can populate it with simple illusions of people or animals. Typically, the ghost can recreate only a handful of images, usually different versions of its bound site as it appeared during the ghost's life. This can't disguise any creatures in the area, though it can cause minor, cosmetic changes (like causing a creature's clothing to appear nicer for a party or bloodstained for a battle). Any creature that touches the illusion or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve it. Creatures can't leave the area of the illusion until they successfully disbelieve it. Pyre's Memory Burning is one of the most painful ways to die, and ghosts that burned to death are often more aggressive and violent than other incorporeal creatures. Their bound site is often scorched or scarred with some other evidence of fire. Pyre's Memory Three Actions (divine, evocation, fire) The ghost causes great gouts of flame to erupt without warning. The ghost picks three 5-foot squares within 30 feet. Creatures that start in or enter one of these squares take 1d6 fire damage per 2 levels the ghost has, subject to a basic Reflex save. The flames last for 1 minute and don't set other things alight unless the ghost wishes. If the ghost uses this ability again, it dismisses any existing flames. Revenant Not all ghosts try to possess the living. Some prefer to ride corpses instead, wrenching bodies from shallow graves to serve as their hosts. Revenant Two Actions or 1 hour; Effect The ghost possesses and transforms an adjacent corpse (this requires 2 actions if the ghost is possessing its own corpse; otherwise, it takes an hour). The possessed corpse uses the statistics of a non-incorporeal undead 2 levels lower than the ghost, and the ghost possesses it as if using the possession spell. The specific undead is determined by the nature of the ghost and the corpse—ghoul, wights, and dullahans are all common, but almost any undead is possible. If the ghost ceases to possess the corpse, the corporeal undead is immediately destroyed.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=51","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"creature-family-52","_score":4.226689,"_source":{"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Ghoul","creature_family_markdown":"Ghoul","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-52","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Ghoul](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=52)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 168\n\nFew creatures are more ubiquitous to sinister locations such as lonely graveyards and ruined crypts than the flesh-eating undead known as ghouls. \r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Barnacle Ghoul](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1001) (Creature 9), [Ghast](/Monsters.aspx?ID=219) (Creature 2), [Ghoul](/Monsters.aspx?ID=218) (Creature 1), [Ghoul Antipaladin](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2154) (Creature 9), [Ghoul Gnawer](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2144) (Creature 11), [Ghoul Razorclaw](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2155) (Creature 13), [Lacedon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1865) (Creature 2), [Leng Ghoul](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1165) (Creature 10), [Priest of Kabriri](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1866) (Creature 5)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Ghoulish Society</title>\r\n\r\nGhouls are quite intelligent and, more so than almost any other undead, prone to forming societies and cultures (if vile and repugnant ones centered around flesh eating and acts of depravity) in tangled warrens below boneyards, or even entire cities hidden away in the depths of the Darklands.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Preternatural Patience</title>\r\n\r\n“On the second morning after the winds stopped, we woke to find that something'd crept into the hold and smashed up all the rations.

To a gnoll, it is almost more offensive to not eat a dead body, no matter its origin; gnolls see no point in wasting precious meat in a harsh and challenging world. Worse still is the refusal to eat the flesh of a dead gnoll, which they consider an insult to that gnoll's memory and sacrifice and an implication that the gnoll's flesh is unworthy of consumption.

[Mammon](/Deities.aspx?ID=68) is worshipped as the bringer of wealth and protector of gremlin warrens that, like his domain of Erebus, are dark and trap-filled.

Chaotic evil gremlins often revere Andirifkhu, demon lord of illusions, knives, and traps.

Most gremlins can use their innate magical abilities to speak with animals, allowing them to bargain with pets and work animals to aid in terrorizing, stealing, or training them to harass their owners. Gremlins especially love to befriend cats, whom they rarely bother, instead bringing them into their pranks and schemes as coconspirators.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Gremlin Society</title>\r\n\r\nMost gremlin communities are egalitarian and cooperative, with little importance placed on familial ties compared to the bond of the community as a whole. Gremlin leaders are often the youngest and most annoying members of a group, achieving their positions by harassing an old leader into resigning or bullying the other gremlins into obedience. Gremlin adults encourage the children to explore by themselves, in hopes that they busy themselves harassing local mortals instead of creating trouble for the other gremlins.\r\n</aside>","name":"Gremlin","primary_source":"Bestiary","primary_source_raw":"Bestiary pg. 192","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2019-08-01","remaster_id":["creature-family-424"],"resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 192\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nGremlins are cruel fey tricksters and saboteurs who have fully acclimated to life on the Material Plane, finding distinct niches for their inventive …\r\n</summary>","skill_mod":{},"source":["Bestiary"],"source_raw":["Bestiary pg. 192"],"source_category":["Rulebooks"],"source_markdown":"[Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 192","speed":{},"summary":"Gremlins are cruel fey tricksters and saboteurs who have fully acclimated to life on the Material Plane, finding distinct niches for their inventive …","summary_markdown":"Gremlins are cruel fey tricksters and saboteurs who have fully acclimated to life on the Material Plane, finding distinct niches for their inventive …","text":" Gremlin Source Bestiary pg. 192 Gremlins are cruel fey tricksters and saboteurs who have fully acclimated to life on the Material Plane, finding distinct niches for their inventive destructiveness.

Gremlin Bells Superstitious societies sometimes hang tiny bells made of semiprecious metals in the belief that such bells will dissuade gremlins from destroying an affixed object or infesting a home. Strangely enough, most gremlins believe this superstition as well, and even when a gremlin bell hasn’t been magically enhanced, a gremlin usually won’t risk tinkering with objects that seem to be protected in such a manner. Gremlin Faith Lawful evil gremlins are sometimes drawn to the worship of archdevils, though not in an orthodox fashion. Dispater is revered as the archdevil of cities—playgrounds to engage in thievery and sabotage. Mammon is worshipped as the bringer of wealth and protector of gremlin warrens that, like his domain of Erebus, are dark and trap-filled. Neutral evil gremlins have been known to worship Norgorber in his aspect as a patron of thieves, but pugwampis in particular prefer to worship gnolls (or at least, worship whoever the local gnolls worship). Chaotic evil gremlins often revere Andirifkhu, demon lord of illusions, knives, and traps. Those that retain a connection to the First World may swear allegiance to the Lantern King, Eldest of laughter, mischief, and transmutation. Gremlin Minions Most know better than to employ gremlins, so when the fey creatures live side-by-side with others, it's often as parasites and unwelcome guests. Imaginative and sinister folk who find themselves infested sometimes catch the gremlins and release them in the homes of their enemies. Gremlin Pets Gremlins making their nests near mortals' homes inevitably encounter domesticated animals. Most gremlins can use their innate magical abilities to speak with animals, allowing them to bargain with pets and work animals to aid in terrorizing, stealing, or training them to harass their owners. Gremlins especially love to befriend cats, whom they rarely bother, instead bringing them into their pranks and schemes as coconspirators. Gremlin Society Most gremlin communities are egalitarian and cooperative, with little importance placed on familial ties compared to the bond of the community as a whole. Gremlin leaders are often the youngest and most annoying members of a group, achieving their positions by harassing an old leader into resigning or bullying the other gremlins into obedience. Gremlin adults encourage the children to explore by themselves, in hopes that they busy themselves harassing local mortals instead of creating trouble for the other gremlins.

After long years of research and the creation of a special container called a [soul cage](/Equipment.aspx?ID=488), a spellcaster takes the final step by imbibing a deadly concoction or casting dreadful incantations that transform them into a lich. While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulfill some long-term plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulfill some malevolent purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter history—both that of those who transform themselves and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich's new power.\n\n After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich's lair is a good indicator of the undead's current mental state.\n\n For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its soul cage, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its soul cage is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Demilich](/Monsters.aspx?ID=283) (Creature 15), [Horde Lich](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1876) (Creature 15), [Lich](/Monsters.aspx?ID=282) (Creature 12), [Runecarved Lich](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1877) (Creature 19)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Associated Monsters</title>\r\n\r\nUndead minions are very common companions for a lich or demilich. Liches prefer mindless undead, that do what they’re told and don’t interrupt the lich’s studies with useless conversation. Liches with a knack for crafting are also fond of surrounding themselves with construct servitors and guardians, such as golems.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Corrupted Transformation</title>\r\n\r\nA failed ritual to become a lich usually results in a painful death, but things can go worse. Potential corruptions include losing all spellcasting ability, an inferior _soul cage_ that takes 1 damage each day as it slowly degenerates, or a delay (typically 1d4 years) before the lich rises as undead.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Less Common Liches</title>\r\n\r\nMost who seek this form of unlife are powerful arcane spellcasters— [wizards](/Classes.aspx?ID=12) in particular. [Clerics](/Classes.aspx?ID=5) and [druids](/Classes.aspx?ID=6) almost never seek lichdom. [Bards](/Classes.aspx?ID=3) are less rare, due to their inquisitive nature and exploration of the occult. Some [sorcerers](/Classes.aspx?ID=11) seek out lichdom, especially those of the [undead bloodline](/Bloodlines.aspx?ID=10). [Witches](/Classes.aspx?ID=16) sometimes follow this path, especially if they learn the secret of transforming their familiar into a _soul cage_.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">The Ritual</title>\r\n\r\nThe ritual to become a lich is unique to each character, but they frequently have similar elements. The ritual is at least 6th level, but it's always heightened to as high a level as possible for the primary caster. The skill check is tied to the primary caster's tradition ([Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2) for [arcane](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1), [Nature](/Skills.aspx?ID=10) for [primal](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=4), [Occult](/Skills.aspx?ID=11) for [occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3), and [Religion](/Skills.aspx?ID=13) for [divine](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=2)), and the caster must be a master in that skill to attempt this ritual. Secondary casters are rarely required. Before starting the ritual, the caster must construct the _soul cage_, which costs a minimum of 100 gp per level of the caster (often more) and a [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) check with a [hard DC for the caster's level](/Rules.aspx?ID=554).\n\n Aside from these base requirements, the ritual also has at least three unique requirements. The first is a significant sacrifice crucial to the life and experiences of the primary caster. The second is a source of great power related to the caster's tradition, to be consumed during the ritual. The third is a poignant means to end the primary caster's life, consumed in the closing seconds of the ritual. If any of these are absent, or improperly performed, it reduces the degree of success for the primary caster's skill check to complete the ritual by one level for each missing requirement. Each of these should be difficult to obtain, requiring a significant quest or great personal sacrifice.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_6_Geb.png\">The Whispering Way</title>\r\n\r\nSome believe that undeath is the purest form of existence, free from pain or fear, unshackled from the cycle of life and death. Loosely organized, adherents to this philosophy call it the Whispering Way, and although it may act like a cult in many regards, it has no true leader or structure. Membership is achieved only by pledging oneself to undeath with the goal of eventually achieving that state through some means or another.\n\n Lichdom is seen as one of best ways of achieving this, though other means are generally acceptable. Undead who need the living to fuel their unlife generally shun this philosophy, as its true goal of turning all life to undeath runs counter to their needs.\n\n Of all its adherents, the Whispering Tyrant is by far the most famous and successful member, nearly achieving the group's goal before being defeated by a massive alliance of mortal forces. Now that the Tyrant has returned, those who follow this philosophy are hopeful that their time of ascendancy is finally at hand.\r\n</aside>\n\n<title level=\"2\">Creating a Lich</title>\r\n\r\nA lich can be any type of spellcaster, as long as it has the ability to perform a ritual of undeath as the primary caster (which can usually be performed only by a spellcaster capable of casting 6th-level spells). To create a lich, follow these steps.<br /> Increase the spellcaster's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.<br /> Increase spell DCs and spell attack roll by 2. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Lich Abilities</title> A lich gains the [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) trait and becomes evil.

A lich can be permanently destroyed only if its soul cage is found and destroyed.<br /> **Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38)<br /> **Resistances** [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27) 20, physical 15 (except [magic](/Traits.aspx?ID=103) bludgeoning)<br /> **Frightful Presence** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) 60 feet, DC 30<br /> **Hand of the Lich** All liches have a hand unarmed attack that deals 1d8 negative damage for every 3 levels and inflicts a paralyzing touch. This attack has the [finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=179) trait.<br /> **Drain Soul Cage** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The lich taps into its soul cage's power to cast any arcane spell up to the highest level the lich can cast, even if the spell being cast is not one of the lich's prepared spells. The lich's soul cage doesn't need to be present for the lich to use this ability.<br /> **Paralyzing Touch** ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) A creature damaged by the lich's hand Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save against the lich's spell DC – 4. The creature becomes [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28) for 1 round on a failure. On a critical failure, the creature is paralyzed permanently, falls [prone](/Conditions.aspx?ID=31), and seems dead. A DC 25 [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) check reveals the victim is alive. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Alternate Lich Abilities</title> Although the abilities above are standard for a lich, you can create a more unusual lich by substituting any one of the following abilities for frightful presence, hand of the lich, Drain Soul Cage, or paralyzing touch.<br /> \n\n### Bestiary\n**Blasphemous Utterances** ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) 10 feet. The lich is accompanied by a constant echo of blasphemous murmurs and tainted whispers. A creature in the aura takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against mental effects and can't take actions that have the concentrate trait unless they succeed at a DC 10 flat check. Failing this check wastes the action.<br /> **Cold Beyond Cold** The lich's hand Strike deals cold damage instead of negative, and instead of being paralyzed, the target is slowed 2. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to slowed 1 (or negates it on a critical success).<br /> **Dark Deliverance** The lich has resistance to positive equal to its level.<br /> **Siphon Life** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** The lich deals damage with its hand Strike. **Effect** The lich regains Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt.<br /> **Void Shroud** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), <t>death, [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) 30 feet. The lich is surrounded by an aura of death, drawing forth souls to be consumed by the lich's constant hunger. Living creatures in the emanation take a –2 status penalty to saves against fear and death effects. In addition, any creature that starts its turn in the area gains the doomed 1 condition unless it succeeds at a Will save against the lich's spell DC – 4.\n\n### Book of the Dead\n  **Animate Cage** The lich has placed their soul cage inside an [animated object](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=4) that fights fiercely to defend itself, or at the very least to elude capture. If the lich's body is destroyed, the lich can control this animated object directly, although they can't cast any spells while inside the vessel. The lich's body is often restored inside this object, being ejected from the animated object after 1d10 days in the normal manner for a soul cage. The animated object is usually at least 4 levels lower than the lich, but it doesn't engage in combat unless directly threatened or if the lich is in control of it.<br /> **Aura of Rot** ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) The lich is surrounded by pervasive, supernatural rot. Unattended food and drink within 30 feet of the lich immediately spoils. Anyone attempting to eat or drink within this area must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or become [sickened 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=34) as the sustenance spoils before it can be ingested (ruining potions and other magical food and drink). Ordinary plants that remain within this aura for more than 1 minute wither and begin to die (depending on their size, this might take significantly longer).<br /> **Familiar Soul** The lich has an undead familiar (using the [familiar](/Rules.aspx?ID=160) rules, except it's undead instead of an animal). Instead of a traditional soul cage, this lich stores their soul in the body of their undead familiar.

After long years of research and the …","text":" Lich Source Bestiary pg. 220 To gain more time to complete their goals, some desperate spellcasters pursue immortality by embracing undeath. After long years of research and the creation of a special container called a soul cage, a spellcaster takes the final step by imbibing a deadly concoction or casting dreadful incantations that transform them into a lich. While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulfill some long-term plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulfill some malevolent purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter history—both that of those who transform themselves and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich's new power. After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich's lair is a good indicator of the undead's current mental state. For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its soul cage, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its soul cage is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation. Members Demilich (Creature 15), Horde Lich (Creature 15), Lich (Creature 12), Runecarved Lich (Creature 19) Associated Monsters Undead minions are very common companions for a lich or demilich. Liches prefer mindless undead, that do what they’re told and don’t interrupt the lich’s studies with useless conversation. Liches with a knack for crafting are also fond of surrounding themselves with construct servitors and guardians, such as golems. Corrupted Transformation A failed ritual to become a lich usually results in a painful death, but things can go worse. Potential corruptions include losing all spellcasting ability, an inferior soul cage that takes 1 damage each day as it slowly degenerates, or a delay (typically 1d4 years) before the lich rises as undead. Less Common Liches Most who seek this form of unlife are powerful arcane spellcasters— wizards in particular. Clerics and druids almost never seek lichdom. Bards are less rare, due to their inquisitive nature and exploration of the occult. Some sorcerers seek out lichdom, especially those of the undead bloodline. Witches sometimes follow this path, especially if they learn the secret of transforming their familiar into a soul cage . The Ritual The ritual to become a lich is unique to each character, but they frequently have similar elements. The ritual is at least 6th level, but it's always heightened to as high a level as possible for the primary caster. The skill check is tied to the primary caster's tradition (Arcana for arcane, Nature for primal, Occult for occult, and Religion for divine), and the caster must be a master in that skill to attempt this ritual. Secondary casters are rarely required. Before starting the ritual, the caster must construct the soul cage , which costs a minimum of 100 gp per level of the caster (often more) and a Crafting check with a hard DC for the caster's level. Aside from these base requirements, the ritual also has at least three unique requirements. The first is a significant sacrifice crucial to the life and experiences of the primary caster. The second is a source of great power related to the caster's tradition, to be consumed during the ritual. The third is a poignant means to end the primary caster's life, consumed in the closing seconds of the ritual. If any of these are absent, or improperly performed, it reduces the degree of success for the primary caster's skill check to complete the ritual by one level for each missing requirement. Each of these should be difficult to obtain, requiring a significant quest or great personal sacrifice. The Whispering Way Some believe that undeath is the purest form of existence, free from pain or fear, unshackled from the cycle of life and death. Loosely organized, adherents to this philosophy call it the Whispering Way, and although it may act like a cult in many regards, it has no true leader or structure. Membership is achieved only by pledging oneself to undeath with the goal of eventually achieving that state through some means or another. Lichdom is seen as one of best ways of achieving this, though other means are generally acceptable. Undead who need the living to fuel their unlife generally shun this philosophy, as its true goal of turning all life to undeath runs counter to their needs. Of all its adherents, the Whispering Tyrant is by far the most famous and successful member, nearly achieving the group's goal before being defeated by a massive alliance of mortal forces. Now that the Tyrant has returned, those who follow this philosophy are hopeful that their time of ascendancy is finally at hand. Creating a Lich A lich can be any type of spellcaster, as long as it has the ability to perform a ritual of undeath as the primary caster (which can usually be performed only by a spellcaster capable of casting 6th-level spells). To create a lich, follow these steps. Increase the spellcaster's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. Increase spell DCs and spell attack roll by 2. Lich Abilities A lich gains the undead trait and becomes evil. Liches lose all abilities that come from being a living creature. A lich gains the following abilities. Darkvision Saving Throws +1 status bonus to all saves vs. positive Negative Healing Rejuvenation (arcane, necromancy) When a lich is destroyed, its soul immediately transfers to its soul cage. A lich can be permanently destroyed only if its soul cage is found and destroyed. Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious Resistances cold 20, physical 15 (except magic bludgeoning) Frightful Presence (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 60 feet, DC 30 Hand of the Lich All liches have a hand unarmed attack that deals 1d8 negative damage for every 3 levels and inflicts a paralyzing touch. This attack has the finesse trait. Drain Soul Cage Free Action Frequency once per day; Effect The lich taps into its soul cage's power to cast any arcane spell up to the highest level the lich can cast, even if the spell being cast is not one of the lich's prepared spells. The lich's soul cage doesn't need to be present for the lich to use this ability. Paralyzing Touch (arcane, curse, incapacitation, necromancy) A creature damaged by the lich's hand Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save against the lich's spell DC – 4. The creature becomes paralyzed for 1 round on a failure. On a critical failure, the creature is paralyzed permanently, falls prone, and seems dead. A DC 25 Medicine check reveals the victim is alive. Alternate Lich Abilities Although the abilities above are standard for a lich, you can create a more unusual lich by substituting any one of the following abilities for frightful presence, hand of the lich, Drain Soul Cage, or paralyzing touch. ### Bestiary Blasphemous Utterances (arcane, aura, enchantment, mental) 10 feet. The lich is accompanied by a constant echo of blasphemous murmurs and tainted whispers. A creature in the aura takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against mental effects and can't take actions that have the concentrate trait unless they succeed at a DC 10 flat check. Failing this check wastes the action. Cold Beyond Cold The lich's hand Strike deals cold damage instead of negative, and instead of being paralyzed, the target is slowed 2. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to slowed 1 (or negates it on a critical success). Dark Deliverance The lich has resistance to positive equal to its level. Siphon Life Reaction Trigger The lich deals damage with its hand Strike. Effect The lich regains Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt. Void Shroud (aura, death, necromancy) 30 feet. The lich is surrounded by an aura of death, drawing forth souls to be consumed by the lich's constant hunger. Living creatures in the emanation take a –2 status penalty to saves against fear and death effects. In addition, any creature that starts its turn in the area gains the doomed 1 condition unless it succeeds at a Will save against the lich's spell DC – 4. ### Book of the Dead Animate Cage The lich has placed their soul cage inside an animated object that fights fiercely to defend itself, or at the very least to elude capture. If the lich's body is destroyed, the lich can control this animated object directly, although they can't cast any spells while inside the vessel. The lich's body is often restored inside this object, being ejected from the animated object after 1d10 days in the normal manner for a soul cage. The animated object is usually at least 4 levels lower than the lich, but it doesn't engage in combat unless directly threatened or if the lich is in control of it. Aura of Rot (arcane, aura, necromancy) The lich is surrounded by pervasive, supernatural rot. Unattended food and drink within 30 feet of the lich immediately spoils. Anyone attempting to eat or drink within this area must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or become sickened 1 as the sustenance spoils before it can be ingested (ruining potions and other magical food and drink). Ordinary plants that remain within this aura for more than 1 minute wither and begin to die (depending on their size, this might take significantly longer). Familiar Soul The lich has an undead familiar (using the familiar rules, except it's undead instead of an animal). Instead of a traditional soul cage, this lich stores their soul in the body of their undead familiar. While doing so makes it significantly more vulnerable, the moment the lich's body is destroyed, it can take over the body of the familiar. After 1 hour, the lich can use this body to cast spells, assuming it has an appendage capable of making somatic components. After 1d10 days, the lich's body reforms as normal. Mask Death Single Action (arcane, transmutation) The lich changes their appearance to look as they did in life. This effect lasts indefinitely, but if the lich takes damage, their rotten flesh beneath becomes visible until this ability is used again. Metamagic Alteration Single Action (concentrate, metamagic) If the lich's next action is to Cast a Spell, they can alter it in one of two ways. Increase the range of that spell by 30 feet (giving it a range of 30 feet if it's a touch spell). Alternatively, the lich can change the area of the spell if the spell has an area and doesn't have a duration. If the spell is a burst with a radius of at least 10 feet, increase the radius by 5 feet. If it is a line or a cone that has an area of 15 feet or smaller, add 10 feet to the area. Pillage Mind Reaction (arcane, divination, mental) Trigger The lich deals damage with their hand Strike; Effect The lich pulls a memory or thought from the target's mind. The lich Recalls Information with a skill of their choice, using the target's bonus with the skill instead of their own. If there's a very specific piece of information the lich hopes to uncover, and the target knows that information, the target can attempt a Will save to keep it secret. On a critical success, the target can give the lich faulty information instead. Steal Soul Reaction (arcane, evil, necromancy) Trigger A creature dies within 30 feet of the lich; Effect The creature must attempt one final Fortitude save. On a failure, the lich siphons the soul from the dying creature, storing it in a black mote of energy that orbits the lich's skull. The creature can't be brought back from the dead while its soul is trapped in this way. Once per day, as a single action, the lich can consume a mote to heal a number of Hit Points equal to double the soul's level. This utterly destroys the soul, making the creature impossible to bring back to life without a wish , miracle , or similar magic. The lich can have a number of motes orbiting them equal to their Charisma modifier (to a minimum of one mote); if the lich gains an additional mote, the oldest one is released, its soul free to travel to the afterlife. Unholy Touch The lich's touch is suffused with evil, dealing evil damage instead of negative. On a critical hit, the target also takes persistent evil damage equal to half the lich's level.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=68","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"creature-family-69","_score":4.226689,"_source":{"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Linnorm","creature_family_markdown":"Linnorm","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-69","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Linnorm](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=69)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Bestiary](/Sources.aspx?ID=2) pg. 224\n\nImmense, primeval dragons of the northern reaches of the world, linnorms hate those they deem to be lesser creatures and seek to inflict as much suffering as possible upon their unfortunate victims.

Members Caustic Monitor (Creature 13), Giant Chameleon (Creature 3), Giant Frilled Lizard (Creature 5), Giant Gecko (Creature 1), Giant Monitor Lizard (Creature 2), Megalania (Creature 7) Lizard Locations Giant lizards can be found in all temperate or tropical climates, often in relatively close proximity to smaller villages or rural regions where they can be a dangerous threat to livestock or travelers. The two lizards presented here tend to dwell in warmer regions— jungles for giant chameleons, and savannas for megalanias. Lizards and Lizardfolk Giant lizards are often used as mounts or guardians or kept as pets, but never so often or as traditionally as they are by lizardfolk. The kinship these people share with giant lizards is unmistakable, valuing their companionship to an extent that equals or even exceeds that which other societies have for popular animal companions like dogs and horses. Other Giant Lizards The three species of giant lizard presented here are but the most common of their kind encountered in the wilds. Stories of much larger lizards persist, including the immense, 20-foot-long monster known as a megalania, a truly enormous version of the giant monitor lizard capable of swallowing creatures whole. Less dangerous is the giant chameleon, although its ability to blend into its environs makes it a much more insidious and stealthy threat than the lumbering, mighty megalania.

The most common of their kind are the dryads, which are spirits that embody great trees, but many other kinds of nymphs exist, including naiads, who watch over bodies of water. All nymphs are guardians of some element of nature, typically a specific tree or pond, or even—in the case of nymph queens—whole forests or massive bodies of water. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Nymph Queens</title> Nymph queens are powerful nymphs that rule over entire regions of untouched wilderness, not just single trees or ponds. Every variety of nymph can have a queen. Naiad queens are among the most prominent, and more often interact with nearby mortals. Thus, some scholars refer to naiad queens as simply “nymphs.” \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Nymph Queen Abilities</title> A nymph queen is 6 to 10 levels higher than an ordinary nymph of the same type, with enhanced numerical statistics and improved Strikes to match. A nymph queen’s ward is a significant region, and she strengthens and vivifies this territory with her presence. Nymph queens are not dependent on their wards and lose the corresponding ability (such as a dryad’s tree dependent ability); instead, they gain the tied to the land ability, as described below.

The most common of their kind are the dryads, which are spirits that embody great trees, but many other kinds of nymphs exist, including naiads, who watch over bodies of water. All nymphs are guardians of some element of nature, typically a specific tree or pond, or even—in the case of nymph queens—whole forests or massive bodies of water. Nymph Queens Nymph queens are powerful nymphs that rule over entire regions of untouched wilderness, not just single trees or ponds. Every variety of nymph can have a queen. Naiad queens are among the most prominent, and more often interact with nearby mortals. Thus, some scholars refer to naiad queens as simply “nymphs.” Nymph Queen Abilities A nymph queen is 6 to 10 levels higher than an ordinary nymph of the same type, with enhanced numerical statistics and improved Strikes to match. A nymph queen’s ward is a significant region, and she strengthens and vivifies this territory with her presence. Nymph queens are not dependent on their wards and lose the corresponding ability (such as a dryad’s tree dependent ability); instead, they gain the tied to the land ability, as described below. A nymph queen also gains the nymph’s beauty aura and the Focus Beauty action, which have varying effects based on the queen’s original type. She gains the Inspiration ability, allowing her to bestow a gift of inspiration on those who catch her fancy, and the Change Shape ability to change her form. Finally, she gains primal prepared spells as a druid of her level. Change Shape Single Action (polymorph, primal, transmutation) Nymph queens can transform between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and any Small or Medium humanoid form, typically choosing a more humanoid-looking version of their natural form. Focus Beauty Single Action (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal, visual) The nymph queen focuses her beauty upon a target within her aura. The creature must attempt a Will save. On a failure, it is affected as if by the nymph queen’s nymph’s beauty aura; if it was already affected by the aura, it suffers a greater effect described in the nymph queen’s entry. A nymph queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature only once per turn. Inspiration Three Actions (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) A nymph queen can inspire a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with the nymph queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks, Performance checks, and Will saves. If a nymph queen grants her Inspiration to a bard and the nymph queen is that bard’s muse, the bard gains an additional benefit depending on their muse theme: for lore muse, the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey. Nymph’s Beauty (aura, emotion, enchantment, mental, primal, visual) 30 feet. Creatures that start their turn in the aura must succeed at a Will save or suffer an effect described in the nymph queen’s entry.

They amass in brutal warbands both large and small, decimating and robbing those unlucky enough to cross their path. Countless small settlements, outposts, and forts have fallen at the hands of orc raiders, whose fecundity and sheer destructiveness leave an indelible mark on the lands they conquer. Survivors of orc invasions are as likely to be fed to the orcs’ war beasts as they are to be taken as slaves. Unspeakable atrocities await any outsiders brought back to orc encampments, and to many, death is a far more preferable outcome compared to capture by orcs.\n\n Physically, orcs tower over most humanoids and look practically custom-made for violence with their rough flesh, sturdy bone, and iron-hard muscle. For all their tough looks, however, orcs are far from invincible. They lack the discipline to conduct large-scale campaigns, for one thing, and they typically lose their heads in the heat of battle. Even their skin scars easily—though this is a source of pride to the orc people, since scars signify strength and experience in battle. To orcs, the crisscross of old wounds are a much a badge of pride and honor as any beheaded foe or claimed trophy.\n\n Orcs are a people of violent passions in all that they do, not just war. Bonds of blood are especially strong among orcs, and lineage is important. The strongest orc bands are typically made up of brothers and sisters in more than arms; orcs fight harder when they are protecting their own kinsfolk, and orc warriors will fight tirelessly to avenge fallen family members. This emphasis on bloodlines is not an altruistic one, however, and is in fact a double-edged sword. Orcs whose families have been killed find themselves at the bottom of the clan’s totem pole, and even a famous chieftain can become powerless overnight if their brethren aren’t there to back them up.\n\n The chaotic and fractious nature of orc culture results in a great variety of beliefs, superstitions, and legacies among different clans. This cultural divergence causes substantial infighting among orc bands, in many cases preventing the rise of larger orc nations. It can also frustrate many attempts at diplomacy, as the taboos of one band may be commonplace and thoroughly accepted practices among others. Navigating a specific band’s culture can often mean the difference between life and death to those who deal with orcs off the field of war.

They amass in brutal warbands both large and small, decimating and robbing those unlucky enough to cross their path. Countless small settlements, outposts, and forts have fallen at the hands of orc raiders, whose fecundity and sheer destructiveness leave an indelible mark on the lands they conquer. Survivors of orc invasions are as likely to be fed to the orcs’ war beasts as they are to be taken as slaves. Unspeakable atrocities await any outsiders brought back to orc encampments, and to many, death is a far more preferable outcome compared to capture by orcs. Physically, orcs tower over most humanoids and look practically custom-made for violence with their rough flesh, sturdy bone, and iron-hard muscle. For all their tough looks, however, orcs are far from invincible. They lack the discipline to conduct large-scale campaigns, for one thing, and they typically lose their heads in the heat of battle. Even their skin scars easily—though this is a source of pride to the orc people, since scars signify strength and experience in battle. To orcs, the crisscross of old wounds are a much a badge of pride and honor as any beheaded foe or claimed trophy. Orcs are a people of violent passions in all that they do, not just war. Bonds of blood are especially strong among orcs, and lineage is important. The strongest orc bands are typically made up of brothers and sisters in more than arms; orcs fight harder when they are protecting their own kinsfolk, and orc warriors will fight tirelessly to avenge fallen family members. This emphasis on bloodlines is not an altruistic one, however, and is in fact a double-edged sword. Orcs whose families have been killed find themselves at the bottom of the clan’s totem pole, and even a famous chieftain can become powerless overnight if their brethren aren’t there to back them up. The chaotic and fractious nature of orc culture results in a great variety of beliefs, superstitions, and legacies among different clans. This cultural divergence causes substantial infighting among orc bands, in many cases preventing the rise of larger orc nations. It can also frustrate many attempts at diplomacy, as the taboos of one band may be commonplace and thoroughly accepted practices among others. Navigating a specific band’s culture can often mean the difference between life and death to those who deal with orcs off the field of war. Although orcs, as a rule, rarely deal with outsiders, they recognize the benefits of trade and willingly swap resources with other violent peoples like hobgoblins, drow, and many humans.

Psychopomp Traitors Some psychopomps view their task of sorting souls as ultimately hollow and meaningless, since the multiverse itself must one day end. Eons ago, these rebels shirked their duties and fled to the empty corners of the planes, becoming a new type of evil creature called a sahkil. Sahkils feed on mortal fears, particularly fears of death, and enjoy tormenting those who must die. Psychopomps generally leave these malcontents alone, except when sahkils interfere with the proper flow of souls. Psychopomps Divinities The most powerful of the psychopomps are unique demigods known collectively as “ushers,” each of whom has its own cult. These psychopomp divinities include Atropos, the Last Sister; Barzahk, the Passage; Ceyanan, the Shepherd; Dammar, the Denied; Imot, the Symbol of Doom; Mother Vulture, the Flesheater; Mrtyu, Death's Consort; Narakas, the Cleansing Sentence; the Pale Horse; Phlegyas, Consoler of Atheists; Saloc, Minder of Immortals; Teshallas, the Primordial Poison; and Vale, the Court of the Ancestors.

Those who parley with shadows, typically by keeping them at bay with a glowing weapon, may learn great secrets, for they are ideal spies. Shadow Variants Source Pathfinder #183: Field of Maidens pg. 73 While the vast majority of shadows are humanoid in shape, shadows can appear in different forms, such as those of predatory animals or terrifying beasts. Sometimes called feral shadows, these shadows are often more animalistic and aggressive than humanoid-shaped shadows. In addition, some variant shadows have the following alternate rules that adjust the shadow stat block. These changes don't adjust the shadow's level. Darting Shadows Some shadows have taken their ability to hide in shadows to a greater level, shifting from one shadow to another with supernatural ease. Darting shadows gain the following ability. Shadow Hop Two Actions (magical, teleportation) Requirements The shadow is in an area of dim light; Effect The shadow teleports from its space to a clear space it can see that is in dim light or darkness within 60 feet. A shadow using this ability is slowed 1 for 1 round after arriving at its destination. Possessing Shadows Some greater shadows develop the coveted ability to possess a body. Only greater shadows can become possessing shadows, and they can't use Slink in Shadows or Steal Shadow while using Inhabit. Inhabit Two Actions The shadow attempts to possess an adjacent undead corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the possession spell, except the shadow doesn't have a physical body, so it's unaffected by the spell's restriction. Shadow Thief Some shadows gain the ability to handle objects. A shadow thief can't use Slink in Shadows or Steal Shadow while using Shadow Touch. Shadow Touch Two Actions The shadow Interacts with a simple physical object, such as picking up a book or opening a door (it can't manipulate a complicated object, like a lock). It can't carry more than a single physical object of up to 2 Bulk. It must use Shadow Touch to keep its hold on the item each turn, or it drops the item at the end of its turn. Members Greater Shadow (Creature 7), Shadow (Creature 4) Shadow Locations Shadows might lurk in any dimly lit area—a corner in a crumbling ruin, a room lit by flickering candles, or a shaded forest at dusk. They travel to and from the Shadow Plane, though it is unclear if they do so via their own magic or by aligning themselves with a more powerful being capable of such planar shifting.

Veins bulge across sinspawn’s bodies in sanguine patterns that suspiciously resemble twisted runes, and their flesh is pale and hairless. Their heads are elongated, bearing only slits for a nose, red eyes, and disturbing lower jaws that split in half at the chin, revealing pedipalps that end in tiny, three-fingered hands and framing a long, lolling tongue. Sinspawn stand 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh as much as an emaciated human of their size.

If you give a skeleton more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics. \n\n### Bestiary\n **Bloody** The skeleton is covered in dripping blood and gains [fast healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=15) equal to its level. \n\n **Collapse** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> **Trigger** The skeleton is critically hit. **Effect** The skeleton collapses into a pile of bones and the attack deals only normal damage. The skeleton can reform in a standing position as an action, but until it does, it is [immobilized](/Conditions.aspx?ID=24) and [flat-footed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=16).\n\n **Explosive Death** When the skeleton is destroyed, its bones shatter and explode as the necromantic energy holding it together is released. Adjacent creatures take 1d6 slashing damage per 2 levels (minimum 1d6) with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save.\n\n **Screaming Skull** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) The skeleton removes its skull and throws it, making a jaws attack with a range of 20 feet. It then attempts to [Demoralize](/Actions.aspx?ID=53) each foe within 10 feet of the target. The head bounces, rolls, or even flies back, returning to the skeleton at the start of its next turn. The skeleton is [blind](/Conditions.aspx?ID=1) until then. \n\n### Bestiary 3\n **Blaze** The skeleton is wreathed with fire, which doesn't consume its bones or gear. The skeleton gains immunity to [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72) and weakness 5 to cold, loses its resistance to [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27), and its Strikes deal additional [persistent fire damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) equal to half the skeleton's level (minimum 1 damage).<br /> <br /> **Bone Missile** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> The skeleton yanks a rib from its ribcage to use as an arrow or javelin. The skeleton loses HP equal to its level (minimum 1), then makes a ranged Strike. This uses the attack bonus of whichever of the skeleton's other Strikes has the highest attack bonus and deals piercing damage equal to that Strike's damage plus the skeleton's level (minimum 1).\n\n **Bone Powder** **Source** When the skeleton takes physical damage from a critical hit, one of its bones is pulverized into a fine powder. All creatures in a 5-foot emanation that breathe take 1d6 [persistent poison damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) (plus an additional 1d6 for every 6 levels the skeleton has). \n\n **Skeleton of Roses**  Thick briars have grown through the skeleton's bones, covering it in red roses with inch-long thorns. The skeleton's unarmed melee Strikes deal additional piercing damage equal to 1/3 the skeleton's level (minimum 1 damage). At the end of each of its turns, if the skeleton has caused piercing damage with its thorns, it regains HP equal to its level (minimum 1). Each time the skeleton regains HP in this way, another rose blossoms. \n\n### Book of the Dead\n**Aquatic Bones** The skeleton has bones from aquatic creatures, allowing it to swim using a simple tail, paddles, or similar appendage. The skeleton has a swim Speed of 20 feet and gains the [aquatic](/Traits.aspx?ID=168) trait and the [aquatic ambush](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=2) ability.\n\n **Bone Storm** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The skeleton transforms into a cyclone of bones, taking up the same space, but twice as tall. It then Strides up to double its Speed. It can move through spaces occupied by other creatures, and this movement doesn't trigger reactions. Creatures the bone storm moves through take 1d6 slashing damage for every 2 levels of the skeleton, with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save against the [hard DC for the creature's level](/Rules.aspx?ID=554). A level 1 or lower skeleton only moves; it doesn't deal damage. A creature attempts this save only once even if the bone storm moved through its space multiple times. At the end of the movement, the skeleton reforms.\n\n **Crumbling Bones** The skeleton is made from crumbling bones that drift in clouds of dust. The skeleton has a fly Speed of 20 but it must end its turn within no more than 5 feet off the ground, or it falls, taking damage as normal. In addition, the skeleton can move through any space that's large enough for its skull to fit through.\n\n **Frozen** The skeleton's bones are covered in a thin layer of ice. The skeleton gains immunity to [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27) and weakness 5 to [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72) and loses resistance to fire. The skeleton is surrounded by an aura of cold that deals cold damage equal to half the skeleton's level to all adjacent creatures at the start of the skeleton's turn ([basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save with a [standard DC for its level](/Rules.aspx?ID=554)).\n\n **Grave Eruption** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> **Requirements** The skeleton is [undetected](/Conditions.aspx?ID=39) and buried in dirt, gravel, or other loose material; **Effect** The skeleton erupts from the ground, Stands, and makes a melee Strike. The target is [flat-footed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=16) against this Strike. If the Strike hits, the target is [frightened 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19) (or frightened 2 on a critical hit).\n\n **Lacquered** During the process to create the skeleton, it was covered with several layers of an alchemical lacquer, giving its bones a golden hue and granting added protection. The skeleton gains [acid](/Traits.aspx?ID=3) resistance 5 and a +2 status bonus to saves against effects that age or erode the target.\n\n **Nimble** The skeleton is particularly fast and nimble. Its land Speed increases by 10 feet and it has a climb Speed of 20 feet. In addition, it gains the [Nimble Dodge](/Feats.aspx?ID=550) reaction.\n\n **Rotten** The bones of this skeleton are black and rotten, having spent years in polluted water or some other foul substance. The skeleton loses its resistance to piercing and slashing damage and is surrounded by a horrific stench in a 10-foot aura. A creature entering or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save against the [standard DC of the skeleton's level](/Rules.aspx?ID=554) or become [sickened 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=34) (plus [slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35) for as long as it remains sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, affected creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46) and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.<br /> This stench remains for 1 hour after the rotten skeleton has been destroyed unless the bones are burned, or the rot is washed away with at least 1 gallon of water.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Beetle Carapace](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1902) (Creature 6), [Drake Skeleton](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1903) (Creature 8), [Harpy Skeleton](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1298) (Creature 5), [Skeletal Champion](/Monsters.aspx?ID=373) (Creature 2), [Skeletal Giant](/Monsters.aspx?ID=375) (Creature 3), [Skeletal Horse](/Monsters.aspx?ID=374) (Creature 2), [Skeletal Hulk](/Monsters.aspx?ID=376) (Creature 7), [Skeletal Mage](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1901) (Creature 5), [Skeletal Soldier](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1900) (Creature 1), [Skeletal Titan](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1904) (Creature 13), [Skeleton Guard](/Monsters.aspx?ID=372) (Creature -1), [Skeleton Infantry](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1300) (Creature 11), [Tyrannosaurus Skeleton](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1299) (Creature 9), [Wolf Skeleton](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1899) (Creature 0)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Creating Skeletons</title>\r\n\r\nStart with a skeleton of the appropriate size.

Skeletons that spend centuries in an underground cavern with a lava lake often end up blazing. Corpses whose graves become overrun with briars and brambles sometimes rise with life-draining thorns, while skeletons in vermin-infested earth often take some of those vermin with them when animated.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_6_Geb.png\">The Skeletal Path</title>\r\n\r\nDiviners cast animal bones with a record of small successes. With necromancy, one can see far beyond. Animated skeletons presented with non-specific orders move in eddies as a school of fish might. Careful observation reveals patterns.

Skeleton Abilities Most skeletons have one of these abilities. If you give a skeleton more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics. ### Bestiary Bloody The skeleton is covered in dripping blood and gains fast healing equal to its level. Collapse Reaction Trigger The skeleton is critically hit. Effect The skeleton collapses into a pile of bones and the attack deals only normal damage. The skeleton can reform in a standing position as an action, but until it does, it is immobilized and flat-footed. Explosive Death When the skeleton is destroyed, its bones shatter and explode as the necromantic energy holding it together is released. Adjacent creatures take 1d6 slashing damage per 2 levels (minimum 1d6) with a basic Reflex save. Screaming Skull Two Actions (auditory, emotion, fear, mental) The skeleton removes its skull and throws it, making a jaws attack with a range of 20 feet. It then attempts to Demoralize each foe within 10 feet of the target. The head bounces, rolls, or even flies back, returning to the skeleton at the start of its next turn. The skeleton is blind until then. ### Bestiary 3 Blaze The skeleton is wreathed with fire, which doesn't consume its bones or gear. The skeleton gains immunity to fire and weakness 5 to cold, loses its resistance to cold, and its Strikes deal additional persistent fire damage equal to half the skeleton's level (minimum 1 damage). Bone Missile Two Actions The skeleton yanks a rib from its ribcage to use as an arrow or javelin. The skeleton loses HP equal to its level (minimum 1), then makes a ranged Strike. This uses the attack bonus of whichever of the skeleton's other Strikes has the highest attack bonus and deals piercing damage equal to that Strike's damage plus the skeleton's level (minimum 1). Bone Powder Source When the skeleton takes physical damage from a critical hit, one of its bones is pulverized into a fine powder. All creatures in a 5-foot emanation that breathe take 1d6 persistent poison damage (plus an additional 1d6 for every 6 levels the skeleton has). Skeleton of Roses Thick briars have grown through the skeleton's bones, covering it in red roses with inch-long thorns. The skeleton's unarmed melee Strikes deal additional piercing damage equal to 1/3 the skeleton's level (minimum 1 damage). At the end of each of its turns, if the skeleton has caused piercing damage with its thorns, it regains HP equal to its level (minimum 1). Each time the skeleton regains HP in this way, another rose blossoms. ### Book of the Dead Aquatic Bones The skeleton has bones from aquatic creatures, allowing it to swim using a simple tail, paddles, or similar appendage. The skeleton has a swim Speed of 20 feet and gains the aquatic trait and the aquatic ambush ability. Bone Storm Three Actions Frequency once per day; Effect The skeleton transforms into a cyclone of bones, taking up the same space, but twice as tall. It then Strides up to double its Speed. It can move through spaces occupied by other creatures, and this movement doesn't trigger reactions. Creatures the bone storm moves through take 1d6 slashing damage for every 2 levels of the skeleton, with a basic Reflex save against the hard DC for the creature's level. A level 1 or lower skeleton only moves; it doesn't deal damage. A creature attempts this save only once even if the bone storm moved through its space multiple times. At the end of the movement, the skeleton reforms. Crumbling Bones The skeleton is made from crumbling bones that drift in clouds of dust. The skeleton has a fly Speed of 20 but it must end its turn within no more than 5 feet off the ground, or it falls, taking damage as normal. In addition, the skeleton can move through any space that's large enough for its skull to fit through. Frozen The skeleton's bones are covered in a thin layer of ice. The skeleton gains immunity to cold and weakness 5 to fire and loses resistance to fire. The skeleton is surrounded by an aura of cold that deals cold damage equal to half the skeleton's level to all adjacent creatures at the start of the skeleton's turn (basic Reflex save with a standard DC for its level). Grave Eruption Two Actions Requirements The skeleton is undetected and buried in dirt, gravel, or other loose material; Effect The skeleton erupts from the ground, Stands, and makes a melee Strike. The target is flat-footed against this Strike. If the Strike hits, the target is frightened 1 (or frightened 2 on a critical hit). Lacquered During the process to create the skeleton, it was covered with several layers of an alchemical lacquer, giving its bones a golden hue and granting added protection. The skeleton gains acid resistance 5 and a +2 status bonus to saves against effects that age or erode the target. Nimble The skeleton is particularly fast and nimble. Its land Speed increases by 10 feet and it has a climb Speed of 20 feet. In addition, it gains the Nimble Dodge reaction. Rotten The bones of this skeleton are black and rotten, having spent years in polluted water or some other foul substance. The skeleton loses its resistance to piercing and slashing damage and is surrounded by a horrific stench in a 10-foot aura. A creature entering or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save against the standard DC of the skeleton's level or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1 for as long as it remains sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, affected creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute. This stench remains for 1 hour after the rotten skeleton has been destroyed unless the bones are burned, or the rot is washed away with at least 1 gallon of water. Members Beetle Carapace (Creature 6), Drake Skeleton (Creature 8), Harpy Skeleton (Creature 5), Skeletal Champion (Creature 2), Skeletal Giant (Creature 3), Skeletal Horse (Creature 2), Skeletal Hulk (Creature 7), Skeletal Mage (Creature 5), Skeletal Soldier (Creature 1), Skeletal Titan (Creature 13), Skeleton Guard (Creature -1), Skeleton Infantry (Creature 11), Tyrannosaurus Skeleton (Creature 9), Wolf Skeleton (Creature 0) Creating Skeletons Start with a skeleton of the appropriate size. (Gargantuan skeletons can use skeletal hulk with the elite template, Gargantuan size, and 5 feet more reach.) Add Strikes, Speeds, or other abilities it would gain from its shape. For instance, a chimera skeleton might have a horn attack with its goat head and jaw attacks with its dragon and lion heads, but not a fist attack. First to Rise I can still remember the first time I was able to draw forth the right combination of incantations and gestures to bring a small pile of bones to life. To see them draw together and assemble, then stand, looking at me with empty eyes, waiting to obey my command. For myself, is the only intoxicant that has ever held any allure. Fortunately, I cast off the bonds of sentimentality long ago. Although, come to think of it, I think that skeletal cat still lingers in one of my many vaults. Patchwork Skeletons A skeleton's connection to its mortal remains is tenuous. One that's damaged can fairly easily replace a broken bone with a similar bone scavenged from another creature. A skeleton can eventually have its entire body replaced, bone by bone. Skeletons don't have much of an identity, making it unclear whether this is still the same creature. Radiant Rebirth When the powerful lich called the Whispering Tyrant returned from imprisonment, he unleashed the Radiant Fire that laid waste to several towns and cities around his prison of Gallowspire. Most of the fallen were left where they died, slowly steeping in necromantic energy. In the early days after these attacks, zombies commonly roamed the area, but as the years pass, skeletons have become more and more numerous. Skeleton Origins Necromancers occasionally add a little something extra to skeletons they animate, but sometimes skeletons can pick up aspects of their environment. Skeletons that spend centuries in an underground cavern with a lava lake often end up blazing. Corpses whose graves become overrun with briars and brambles sometimes rise with life-draining thorns, while skeletons in vermin-infested earth often take some of those vermin with them when animated. The Skeletal Path Diviners cast animal bones with a record of small successes. With necromancy, one can see far beyond. Animated skeletons presented with non-specific orders move in eddies as a school of fish might. Careful observation reveals patterns. This requires a large number of skeletons. Fortunately, a resource in which I am prosperous. Unlife without Flesh The necromantic energies that infuse animated undead skeletons give them the ability to see without eyes and move without muscles. Despite being mindless, skeletons’ instinct to evil comes from their corrupt vital essence, perverting negative energy for creation rather than destruction.

Such “troll kings” possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible monster traditionally associated with the name to the water-dwelling scrag and hybrid flood troll. Regional variations exist as well—mountain trolls among stony peaks, for instance, or moss trolls in swampy bayous— but all share the same trademark regenerative powers and insatiable thirst for blood. Members Cavern Troll (Creature 6), Frost Troll (Creature 4), Jotund Troll (Creature 15), Tombstone Troll (Creature 1), Troll (Creature 5), Troll King (Creature 10), Two-Headed Troll (Creature 8) Troll Augurs Particularly devout trolls, called augurs, claim to possess the so‑called “gift of sight,” which they believe was granted them by the demon lord Urxehl. Augurs practice a disturbing method of future‑telling, in which a troll slashes open its own abdomen and pulls out its entrails to interpret the prophecies in its quivering innards. Other cultists prod and agitate their gutted diviner to keep it conscious throughout the gruesome ordeal. Troll Blood The blood of trolls is a valuable and difficult-to-procure substance of intense interest to alchemists, witches, and doctors the world over. Though initially it is of little interest other than its unnaturally vibrant hue, when processed correctly its applications are numerous. Experiments have produced oils that restore lost limbs, potions that grant the imbiber supernatural strength, and even smoke bombs that cause anyone caught in the haze to fly into an unstoppable rage.

If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=90) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91). You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme.\n\n**[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)**\n\n **Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyze](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145)\n\n **Coffin Restoration** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118)) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38). If its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally.\n\n **Vampire Weaknesses** All vampires possess the following weaknesses.\n<ul><li>**Compulsions** Vampires are creatures of strange and unknowable compulsions. A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions—a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion (see below).</li> <li>**Revulsion** A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to [Raising a Shield](/Actions.aspx?ID=98)). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a vampire can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li> <li>**Stake** A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38). If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li> <li>**Sunlight** If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes [slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35). The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors.</li></ul>**Climb Speed** Vampires gain a climb Speed equal to their land Speed.<br /> **Claws** If the creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) trait. If the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.<br /> **Drink Blood** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)); **Requirement** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. **Effect** The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.<br /> A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.<br /> **Grab** The creature's claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18).\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">True Vampire Abilities</title> Powerful vampires that can create and control vampires from their victims gain additional vampire abilities, as detailed below. A creature below level 5 is not a significant enough creature to become a true vampire—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular vampire spawn, or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 5 before becoming a true vampire.\n\n**Resistances** The vampire resists all physical damage except [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103) silver.\n\n **Create Spawn** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [downtime](/Traits.aspx?ID=49), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.\n\n **Mist Escape** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> **Trigger** The vampire is reduced to 0 HP. **Effect** The vampire uses Turn to Mist. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. It automatically returns to its corporeal form, unconscious, if it reaches its coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.\n\n **Change Shape** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) The vampire transforms into one of its animal forms or back into its normal form. Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the [_aerial form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=4) and [_animal form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=10) spells as guidelines.\n<ul><li>**Bat** The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat. It gains echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as its highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws, but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage.</li></ul>**Children of the Night** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include [rat swarms](/Monsters.aspx?ID=347), [bat swarms](/Monsters.aspx?ID=45), and [wolves](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=101), but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they are within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.\n\n **Dominate** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) The vampire can cast [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=87) at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163) trait. The save DC uses the DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.\n\n **Drink Blood** As a typical vampire, but the victim is drained 2 instead of 1.\n\n **Turn to Mist** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the [_gaseous form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=129) spell, or back to its normal form.

Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually becomes evil. Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1.

If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme. Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyze, poison, sleep Coffin Restoration (divine, necromancy, negative) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls unconscious. If its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally.

If the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage. Drink Blood Single Action (divine, necromancy); Requirement A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vampire's reach.

They live in simple familial communities, battling rival groups and other aggressive Darklands inhabitants in order to survive. They occasionally raid surface settlements, usually at the behest of cruel, bloodthirsty leaders who are often themselves in the thrall of more powerful creatures like nagas or demons. A typical xulgath has dull gray, dark gray, or ashen scales, with a long tail and bony protrusions that run the length of its spine. A typical xulgath is 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.\n\n Although today the xulgaths are brutal and scattered, they were one of the first intelligent humanoids to rise in the primeval world, once ruling over a mighty empire that stretched throughout the Darklands. Today, all that remains of this era are ruins of massive stone ziggurats and crumbling cities found within some of the larger caverns. Some groups of xulgaths continue to live among these ruins, venerating their ancestors’ accomplishments, while others consider these areas taboo and leave them to become infested with Darklands vermin. Sages don’t agree on why the ancient xulgath civilization fell.

They live in simple familial communities, battling rival groups and other aggressive Darklands inhabitants in order to survive. They occasionally raid surface settlements, usually at the behest of cruel, bloodthirsty leaders who are often themselves in the thrall of more powerful creatures like nagas or demons. A typical xulgath has dull gray, dark gray, or ashen scales, with a long tail and bony protrusions that run the length of its spine. A typical xulgath is 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. Although today the xulgaths are brutal and scattered, they were one of the first intelligent humanoids to rise in the primeval world, once ruling over a mighty empire that stretched throughout the Darklands. Today, all that remains of this era are ruins of massive stone ziggurats and crumbling cities found within some of the larger caverns. Some groups of xulgaths continue to live among these ruins, venerating their ancestors’ accomplishments, while others consider these areas taboo and leave them to become infested with Darklands vermin. Sages don’t agree on why the ancient xulgath civilization fell. Some suspect it was the result of a loss of several wars waged against serpentfolk, while others suggest that the corruptive influence of demon worship rotted their culture from within.

This damage increases by 1d6 for every 6 levels the zombie has.

The zombie loses its weakness to slashing and gains resistance against all damage equal to its level (minimum 3), and it gains weakness equal to twice its level (minimum 6) to critical hits. Increase the zombie's level by 1 if you give it this ability. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Additional Monster Abilities</title>\n\n### Bestiary 3\nYou can modify zombies with the following zombie abilities, in addition to those found on page 340 of the _Bestiary_. Most zombies have one of these abilities; if you give a zombie more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics. \n\n**Ankle Biter** This zombie fights just as well on the ground as it does standing. While [prone](/Conditions.aspx?ID=31), the zombie isn't [flat-footed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=16), it ignores the status penalty to its attack rolls, and it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) checks to [Trip](/Actions.aspx?ID=40). The zombie can also move up to half its Speed when it [Crawls](/Actions.aspx?ID=76). \n\n**Persistent Limbs** The first time the zombie is critically hit with a melee or ranged Strike, a limb falls off its body and continues to attack. The limb acts on the zombie's initiative; each round it can Stride up to half the zombie's Speed and make a Strike. The limb uses and contributes to the zombie's multiple attack penalty. \n\n**Putrid Stench** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [olfactory](/Traits.aspx?ID=246)) 15 feet. The zombie's rotting flesh is particularly malodorous. A creature that enters the area must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is [sickened 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=34), and on a critical failure, the creature also takes a –5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. While within the aura, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to all zombies' putrid stenches for 1 minute. \n\n**Unholy Speed** The zombie gains a +10 status bonus to all its Speeds\n\n### Book of the Dead\n **Infested** The zombie's flesh is infested with swarming vermin. When the zombie is hit with a critical hit or destroyed, the [swarm](/Traits.aspx?ID=239) is set free. Its initiative is immediately after the zombie's. If the swarm is 4 or more levels lower than the zombie, it isn't worth XP (and doesn't add its XP to the encounter budget).\n\n **Spitting Zombie** The zombie spits acid as a ranged Strike with a range of 30 feet. This uses the highest attack bonus among the zombie's Strikes and deals 1d12 acid damage per 3 levels of the zombie (or 1d6 acid damage below level 3). On a critical hit, the target also takes 1d4 [persistent acid damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) per 3 levels of the zombie. Once used, the zombie must spend 1 action to cough up enough acid to use this ability again.\n\n **Tearing Grapple** The zombies work in groups to rip foes to pieces. Whenever a zombie with this ability successfully [Grapples](/Actions.aspx?ID=35) a foe that's already [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20) or [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33) by another zombie with this ability, they violently struggle over the poor victim, dealing fist damage (or a similar Strike's damage if the zombie doesn't have a fist Strike). If the grapple is a critical success, the target takes double damage and ceases being grabbed or restrained by any other creatures.

In either case, adjacent creatures are hit with vile fluid, causing them to become sickened 1 unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. Feast Two Actions (manipulate) If the zombie is adjacent to a helpless or unconscious creature, or a deceased creature that died in the past hour, the zombie can feast upon its flesh to heal itself. This restores an amount of Hit Points equal to the zombie's level. If the creature is alive, the zombie deals damage equal to its jaws, flst, or claw damage.

Thanks to their acidic saliva and sharp teeth, a biloko can masticate their food into an easy-to-digest pulp, grinding flesh and bone into a compact mush, even while swallowing; thus, they do not flinch while devouring meals two or three times their own size. A recently-fed biloko can be easily recognized by their sagging, distended belly. However, despite their slow appearance, the fey is no less dangerous then, as they delight in killing and might have hungry comrades hiding nearby, waiting to feed. Members Biloko Veteran (Creature 4), Biloko Veteran (Creature 4), Biloko Warrior (Creature 1), Biloko Warrior (Creature 1), Eloko (Creature 7), Eloko (Creature 7) Charming Predators Bilokos' connection to the First World grants them a limited ability to supernaturally charm their enemies. Bilokos use this power to lure stragglers away from their adventuring parties or confuse their opponents when a raid goes horribly awry. Large hunting parties of bilokos might charm entire groups of travelers, in which case these bilokos might bring their enchanted quarry back to their community to feast on (though they are more likely to simply enjoy the spoils of their efforts alone). Elokolobha In the jungles north of Lake Ocota, rumors speak of an incredibly powerful eloko who calls himself Emperor Sharptooth and rules over an entire city of bilokos and other fey, known as Elokolobha. While such coordination between the capricious fey is not unheard of, explorers have been unable to verify these stories, as all who attempt to find the biloko settlement are never seen again. Recently, a group of Pathfinders based out of Nantambu has started collecting funds for an expedition to find this mysterious city and return with information (and possibly a wealth of treasure). The outer structures of Elokolobha ( Lost Omens Mwangi Expanse page 175) are little more than slapdash constructions, a conglomerate of salvage, scrap wood, and crudely carved limestone. High atop the rocky crags, wooden huts perch upon flats and notches. These are connected to each other via rope bridges, ladders, and zip lines. Far more impressive are the caves within the crags themselves, ancient and partially worked into grand, strangely shaped chambers. Guerilla Ambushers Bilokos prefer to move about in small, stealthy packs in dark, isolated sections of the jungle. When a band of bilokos finds a suitable hunting ground, it claims the area exclusively, digging pit traps, crafting snares from vines, and building blinds high in trees where the predators can lie in ambush.

The Shadow Forge Many velstracs forge their own chains, but others outsource the task to unique velstracs known as almoners. These blind, deaf, and mute velstracs resemble six-armed halflings severed at the waist that toil away endlessly at a great burning foundry called the Shadow Forge. Almoners operate under mysterious strictures, and are just as likely to turn a velstrac away empty-handed as they are to hand one a finely crafted chain before the request has even been uttered. Velstrac Divinities The most powerful velstracs are unique divinities known collectively as demagogues—powerful creatures often worshipped by mortals who seek to experience agonizing new revelations and gain power by enhancing the body through pain. Velstracs on Golarion Velstracs are most often encountered in the shadowy realm of Nidal, where the state worship of Zon-Kuthon is rigidly enforced. Indeed, many velstracs are created from the souls of Joyful Things, devotees of Zon-Kuthon who have had their limbs amputated to focus their minds on the veneration of pain, sacrifice, and torment.

Circus owners who mistreat their animals through harsh discipline or overtraining see little wrong with their mercilessness, even going so far as to slaughter their entertainers—supposedly “by accident”—via neglect or abuse. The victims of such cruelty who cannot move onto the afterlife—either because they somehow become infused with negative energy or their spirits cannot rest without first enacting revenge on their assailants—occasionally rise from the dead as visitants.\n\n These undead monsters haunt the sites of their demise and search out the masters who made their lives so hellish with only one goal in mind: vengeance.

Hippocampi have colorful scales ranging from pearly white to seaweed green, and brilliant ribbed dorsal sails as manes. In the wild oceans, most types of hippocampi tend to congregate in the shallows near the beds of seaweed and kelp forests that provide them with food and shelter from predators. They form huge schools to provide safety in numbers, like land-bound horses form herds.\n\n Hippocampi are highly prized by undersea societies and surface dwellers alike, as they are as easy to train as horses and serve many of the same functions, be that as beasts of burden, war-trained mounts, transportation, or as pets.

The most powerful is Inma, the Empress of the World, but Akuma the Horned King, Murona the Dark Mother, and Nataka the Red King are also worshipped. Oni Origins The first oni originated in the nation of Minkai on the continent of Tian Xia. Whether due to prevalent local kami— particularly in the mist-shrouded Forest of Spirits—or its peoples' faiths, Minkai is a hotbed of oni activity. Oni Shapechangers Oni humanoid forms are limited to one specific appearance. An ogre mage can assume only one specific ogre form, while an ice yai can appear only as one specific frost giant. Some oni have greater control over their shapeshifting power and can assume the form of any humanoid creature, and these oni tend to be the most dangerous. Other Oni Different oni exist for nearly every humanoid ancestry. Kuwa oni mask their golden skin and four-fingered claws in human form, while ja oni hide as hobgoblins. Other yai include wind yai (who take their form from cloud giants) and the immensely powerful void yai (who form from other yai and ascend to rule over rune giants).

While many do so on the blades or under the spells of dragonslayers, some manage to outlast their enemies and must, in time, face the truth that awaits all living creatures at the end of their natural lifespan. As with many other creatures, some dragons respond to such looming reminders of their own mortality poorly, and the particularly prideful or wrathful of their kind often lash out in anger when confronted by this grim truth. Peace and acceptance may find some dragons, but the most stubborn of their ilk (and invariably the most wicked) may pursue a different answer to the problem. These dragons seek out sinister rites that can transform them into undead creatures known as raveners.\n\n A ravener’s flesh is stripped away as part of the transformation, leaving only their skeleton. What they lose in flesh, however, the dragon gains in soul-rending power, as their raw spiritual energy forms a protective barrier around their skeleton, keeping it intact and allowing flight with now-skeletal wings. This new existence is not so easy to maintain as other forms of undeath, however, and the ravener must feed regularly on the souls of living creatures to power their profane metabolism. This hunger is much greater than that of a living dragon, so raveners are forced to relocate regularly, traveling to fresh hunting grounds each time they strip their current home of prey. A ravener may depopulate whole regions at a time in order to sate their endless hunger for souls, lest they lose much of their power and become a ravener husk.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Ravener](/Monsters.aspx?ID=783) (Creature 21), [Ravener Husk](/Monsters.aspx?ID=784) (Creature 14)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_3_Locations.png\">Ravener Lairs</title>\r\n\r\nCunning and paranoid, raveners prefer to make their lairs in places hostile to mortal life: atop peaks so high that living creatures struggle to breathe the rarefied air, submerged beneath pools of magma in the caldera of an active volcano, and so on. Some raveners even go so far as to deliberately fill their entire lair with lethally poisonous gases, and raveners that are capable of advanced spellcasting often seal their lairs completely, accessing them exclusively by spells such as [_teleport_](/Spells.aspx?ID=338) or [_gaseous form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=129).

Typically, the dragon must perform a rare ritual called [_ravenous reanimation_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=26), but this requirement can be waived if the prospective ravener has the aid of a powerful patron. In certain unique conditions, such as the intervention of a vile god of undeath, a dragon can transform into a ravener after death without the use of this rite at all. A ravener is a powerful creature that is likely to have a major impact on your game, so you might want to create each one as a custom monster. If you don't have time, you can also create a ravener via the following steps. Increase the dragon's level by 2 and change their statistics as follows. \n<ul><li>They gain the undead trait and the Necril language. </li><li>Increase their AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 2. </li><li>They gain weakness to good damage and more HP (see below). </li><li>The ravener's melee strikes deal an additional 2d6 negative damage, and their damaging Breath Weapon deals an additional 4d6 persistent negative damage.</li></ul> \n\n## Ravener\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Starting Level**</td><td>**HP Increase**</td><td>**Weakness**</td></tr> <tr><td>13-20</td><td>50</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>21 or greater</td><td>90</td><td>20</td></tr> </table></row> \n\n### Ravener Abilities \n A ravener gains the following abilities. \n\n[**Darkvision**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12) \n\n**Soulsense** A ravener senses the spiritual essence of living and undead creatures within the listed range. Creatures whose material bodies are one unit with their souls, like [celestials](/Traits.aspx?ID=23) and [fiends](/Traits.aspx?ID=70), appear brighter to this sense. \n\n**[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)** \n\n**Immunities** death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious \n\n**Cowering Fear** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) A ravener's [frightful presence](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=17) causes creatures to cower in fear as well. As long as a creature is at least [frightened 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19) or more as a result of the ravener's frightful presence, it is also [immobilized](/Conditions.aspx?ID=24) from the fear. \n\n**Soul Ward** An intangible field of necromantic energy protects a ravener from total destruction. A soul ward has 150 maximum Hit Points, or 200 if the ravener is level 21 or higher. Whenever a ravener would be reduced below 1 Hit Point, all damage in excess of what would reduce them to 1 Hit Point is instead dealt to their soul ward. If this damage reduces the soul ward to fewer than 0 Hit Points, the ravener is destroyed. A soul ward's Hit Points can be restored only via specific ravener abilities such as Consume Soul, ravenous breath, or vicious criticals. A ravener who goes more than a week without successfully using Consume Soul to feed on a dying creature starves, and their soul ward loses 1d4 Hit Points each day until they feed. If the ravener's soul ward loses all its Hit Points while the ravener still has more than 1 HP, they become a ravener husk. \n\n**Consume Soul** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> ([death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Trigger** A living creature within 30 feet of the ravener dies; **Effect** The ravener tears the creature's soul from its body with their maw and gulps it down. The dying creature must attempt a DC 44 Fortitude save.\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.<br />\n**Success** The ravener tears off a small chunk of the creature’s soul. If the victim is restored to life, they are [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) in addition to any other side effects of returning to life. The ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to half the creature’s level.<br />\n**Failure** As success, but the creature’s soul is ravaged. The creature is drained 3 and the ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to the creature’s level.<br />\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the ravener devours the entire soul. The victim can’t be restored to life as long as the ravener exists except via a 10th-level effect such as [_miracle_](/Spells.aspx?ID=196) or [_wish_](/Spells.aspx?ID=377), and the ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to twice the creature’s level.\n\n**Discorporate** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Trigger** The ravener takes excess damage to their soul ward but still has at least 51 Hit Points in their soul ward; **Effect** The ravener draws deeply into their soul ward, discorporating their body into soul energy in order to escape. They take 50 damage to their soul ward and their physical body vanishes, reappearing 1d4 hours later in a random location within 1 mile from the location where they used Discorporate. \n\n**Ravenous Breath** A ravener's Breath Weapon is infused with negative energy and strips life essence from the victims. Any creature that fails its save against the ravener's Breath Weapon is drained 1 (or drained 2 on a critical failure). If at least one creature is drained by the ravener's Breath Weapon, the ravener's soul ward gains 5 Hit Points. \n\n**Vicious Criticals** The ravener treats an attack roll as a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, as long as the attack roll was a success. Additionally, whenever the ravener makes a critical hit with one of their Strikes, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) condition. If the target already has a drained value of greater than 0, their drained value instead increases by 1, to a maximum of drained 4. Whenever the ravener applies drain to a creature in this way, their soul ward gains 5 Hit Points.","name":"Ravener","primary_source":"Bestiary 2","primary_source_raw":"Bestiary 2 pg. 222","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2020-05-27","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 222 <sup>2.0</sup>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nThough their lifespans can measure in millennia, all dragons must eventually perish.

While many do so on the blades or under the spells of dragonslayers, some manage to outlast their enemies and must, in time, face the truth that awaits all living creatures at the end of their natural lifespan. As with many other creatures, some dragons respond to such looming reminders of their own mortality poorly, and the particularly prideful or wrathful of their kind often lash out in anger when confronted by this grim truth. Peace and acceptance may find some dragons, but the most stubborn of their ilk (and invariably the most wicked) may pursue a different answer to the problem. These dragons seek out sinister rites that can transform them into undead creatures known as raveners. A ravener’s flesh is stripped away as part of the transformation, leaving only their skeleton. What they lose in flesh, however, the dragon gains in soul-rending power, as their raw spiritual energy forms a protective barrier around their skeleton, keeping it intact and allowing flight with now-skeletal wings. This new existence is not so easy to maintain as other forms of undeath, however, and the ravener must feed regularly on the souls of living creatures to power their profane metabolism. This hunger is much greater than that of a living dragon, so raveners are forced to relocate regularly, traveling to fresh hunting grounds each time they strip their current home of prey. A ravener may depopulate whole regions at a time in order to sate their endless hunger for souls, lest they lose much of their power and become a ravener husk. Members Ravener (Creature 21), Ravener Husk (Creature 14) Ravener Lairs Cunning and paranoid, raveners prefer to make their lairs in places hostile to mortal life: atop peaks so high that living creatures struggle to breathe the rarefied air, submerged beneath pools of magma in the caldera of an active volcano, and so on. Some raveners even go so far as to deliberately fill their entire lair with lethally poisonous gases, and raveners that are capable of advanced spellcasting often seal their lairs completely, accessing them exclusively by spells such as teleport or gaseous form . Of course, raveners must feed on the living to persist, so they never locate their lairs so far from sources of life that they'll starve. Ravener Minions Raveners view most undead creatures with little more respect than they have for living creatures, but they often make use of them as servants. They prefer incorporeal undead such as ghosts, specters, and wraiths over such crude and simple minions as skeletons and zombies. Ravener Patrons While most dragons are too prideful to turn to anyone, even the gods, for help, a few who seek to become raveners are so desperate to stave off death that they might turn to powerful patrons for aid, such as demon lords, evil deities, or powerful necromancers, offering service in exchange for their transformation. Ravener Spellcasters Instead of gaining the vicious criticals ability, a ravener spellcaster gains additional spellcasting prowess. When creating your own ravener spellcaster, give it the spellcasting ability of a spellcaster roughly 2 levels higher than a normal spellcasting dragon of its kind. This typically means that if the original dragon had two spells prepared of its highest level, you should add one more spell of that level and then two spells of the next highest level, while if it had three spells prepared of its highest level, you would add three spells of the next highest level (if applicable, add only a single 10th-level spell). Either way, increase its cantrip level by 1. If the ravener is unusually young, you might be able to use spells from the relevant spellcasting dragon sidebar, but for a typical ancient dragon, consider the following spells to fill in the new slots, depending on which level of spells you need. 10th wish 9th power word kill , telepathic demand , weird 8th disappearance , maze , mind blank 7th contingency , energy aegis , spell turning Ravener Treasure Because they change lairs more often than living dragons, raveners prefer treasure that is compact and easily transported. Instead of sprawling mountains of coins, they tend to prefer precious gems, art objects, and especially magic items, particularly magic items they are capable of using.

Darkvision Soulsense A ravener senses the spiritual essence of living and undead creatures within the listed range. Creatures whose material bodies are one unit with their souls, like celestials and fiends, appear brighter to this sense. Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious Cowering Fear (aura, emotion, fear, mental) A ravener's frightful presence causes creatures to cower in fear as well. As long as a creature is at least frightened 2 or more as a result of the ravener's frightful presence, it is also immobilized from the fear. Soul Ward An intangible field of necromantic energy protects a ravener from total destruction. A soul ward has 150 maximum Hit Points, or 200 if the ravener is level 21 or higher. Whenever a ravener would be reduced below 1 Hit Point, all damage in excess of what would reduce them to 1 Hit Point is instead dealt to their soul ward. If this damage reduces the soul ward to fewer than 0 Hit Points, the ravener is destroyed. A soul ward's Hit Points can be restored only via specific ravener abilities such as Consume Soul, ravenous breath, or vicious criticals. A ravener who goes more than a week without successfully using Consume Soul to feed on a dying creature starves, and their soul ward loses 1d4 Hit Points each day until they feed. If the ravener's soul ward loses all its Hit Points while the ravener still has more than 1 HP, they become a ravener husk. Consume Soul Free Action (death, divine, necromancy) Trigger A living creature within 30 feet of the ravener dies; Effect The ravener tears the creature's soul from its body with their maw and gulps it down. The dying creature must attempt a DC 44 Fortitude save. Critical Success The creature is unaffected. Success The ravener tears off a small chunk of the creature’s soul. If the victim is restored to life, they are drained 1 in addition to any other side effects of returning to life. The ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to half the creature’s level. Failure As success, but the creature’s soul is ravaged. The creature is drained 3 and the ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to the creature’s level. Critical Failure As failure, but the ravener devours the entire soul. The victim can’t be restored to life as long as the ravener exists except via a 10th-level effect such as miracle or wish , and the ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to twice the creature’s level. Discorporate Free Action (divine, necromancy) Trigger The ravener takes excess damage to their soul ward but still has at least 51 Hit Points in their soul ward; Effect The ravener draws deeply into their soul ward, discorporating their body into soul energy in order to escape. They take 50 damage to their soul ward and their physical body vanishes, reappearing 1d4 hours later in a random location within 1 mile from the location where they used Discorporate. Ravenous Breath A ravener's Breath Weapon is infused with negative energy and strips life essence from the victims. Any creature that fails its save against the ravener's Breath Weapon is drained 1 (or drained 2 on a critical failure). If at least one creature is drained by the ravener's Breath Weapon, the ravener's soul ward gains 5 Hit Points. Vicious Criticals The ravener treats an attack roll as a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, as long as the attack roll was a success. Additionally, whenever the ravener makes a critical hit with one of their Strikes, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the drained 1 condition. If the target already has a drained value of greater than 0, their drained value instead increases by 1, to a maximum of drained 4.

Few serpentfolk survive today; their power is shattered, their god [Ydersius](/Deities.aspx?ID=211) decapitated (although not quite slain). The cunning, intelligence, and magical abilities of serpentfolk have diminished from their ancient heights, and most are born without these boons. Those serpentfolk who retain their ancestry’s legacy of intelligence and magic are known as zyss, and they look down upon their more numerous kindred with a mix of disdain and shame. They see these offshoots as a curse on their kind, resulting from their god’s decapitation and the pandemonium during the fall of their underground empire, and have dubbed them aapoph, meaning “chaos made flesh.”\n\n Today, the central realm of the Darklands retains the old name of the serpentfolk empire that once dominated this region—Sekamina. This name is also the source of the serpentfolk’s Aklo title, sekmin, which they are often called in ancient texts. Sekamina itself retains very little of the serpentfolk’s legacy, its mantle of rule having passed on to others like [drow](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=37), [ghouls](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=52), [gugs](/Monsters.aspx?ID=252), and [deep gnomes](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=27). Yet in remote reaches of this dangerous realm, the ruins of serpentfolk cities still stand. Within, a great many serpentfolk sleep in torpor in secluded vaults, with only a few cells awake to enact their schemes. In addition, a small number of serpentfolk settlements dot Golarion’s surface, most of them in humid, remote jungles, far-flung islands, or caverns close to the surface. It’s rare for such a settlement to number more than a few dozen serpentfolk. They rely primarily on slaves to build their power bases, to defend them, and to perform essentially all the practical functions of their society. This includes providing food, crafting goods, and tending to the serpentfolk’s every need.\n\n Zyss serpentfolk are megalomaniacal geniuses with dreams of returning to their place of dominance, though modern serpentfolk have few means of accomplishing this goal. Many of their plans hinge on resurrecting Ydersius, their decapitated god. His headless body still thrashes about, mindless, in the Darklands, waiting to be reunited with his lost skull. Serpentfolk numbers are so small that reclaiming their dominance seems a distant dream, especially since their reproduction is slow. Though a parent can birth a dozen young at once, the gestation period lasts up to a decade, and the likelihood that even one will be zyss is low. There’s no telling whether a child will be zyss or aapoph, regardless of parentage. A coveted zyss child is just as likely to arise from aapoph parents as from two zyss, and every serpentfolk colony has someone in charge of sorting the young, identifying the earliest signs of intelligence in them.\n\n Though the number of zyss is small in serpentfolk colonies, bringing in more zyss isn’t necessarily desirable. A serpentfolk conclave with just a few zyss is functional, but one with a large number becomes fractious. Cults and societies form, all pursuing their own passions and politics, with scheming and backstabbing running rampant. A powerful priest may be able to bring other zyss to heel, but many zyss question why a priest should be in charge if their god is dead. Zyss thrive on selfish desires for hedonistic pleasure and adulation. They feel no love for others, even their offspring. Thriving on decadence, they crave receiving expensive gifts, gorging themselves on massive meals, and pursing arts such as music, poetry, or sculpture. Even more academic hobbies, like the study of magic or warfare, take an artistic bent, like carefully designing colorful illusions or memorizing epic poems about renowned wars. Each zyss believes themself to have more refined tastes than their peers.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Aapoph Serpentfolk](/Monsters.aspx?ID=799) (Creature 3), [Bone Prophet](/Monsters.aspx?ID=801) (Creature 8), [Coil Spy](/Monsters.aspx?ID=800) (Creature 4), [Serpentfolk Granitescale](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1627) (Creature 6), [Serpentfolk Venom Caller](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1628) (Creature 7), [Zyss Serpentfolk](/Monsters.aspx?ID=798) (Creature 2)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Evolving Times</title>\r\n\r\nGranitescales are only one type of aapoph variant to arise in surface colonies, but all display intelligence somewhat greater than ordinary aapophs. Zyss serpentfolk are secretly concerned that their grip on their dull-witted aapoph brethren might slip.

Few serpentfolk …","text":" Serpentfolk Source Bestiary 2 pg. 236 2.0 Before their ancient clash with humanity devastated their civilization, serpentfolk were masters of a sprawling underground empire. Few serpentfolk survive today; their power is shattered, their god Ydersius decapitated (although not quite slain). The cunning, intelligence, and magical abilities of serpentfolk have diminished from their ancient heights, and most are born without these boons. Those serpentfolk who retain their ancestry’s legacy of intelligence and magic are known as zyss, and they look down upon their more numerous kindred with a mix of disdain and shame. They see these offshoots as a curse on their kind, resulting from their god’s decapitation and the pandemonium during the fall of their underground empire, and have dubbed them aapoph, meaning “chaos made flesh.” Today, the central realm of the Darklands retains the old name of the serpentfolk empire that once dominated this region—Sekamina. This name is also the source of the serpentfolk’s Aklo title, sekmin, which they are often called in ancient texts. Sekamina itself retains very little of the serpentfolk’s legacy, its mantle of rule having passed on to others like drow, ghouls, gugs, and deep gnomes. Yet in remote reaches of this dangerous realm, the ruins of serpentfolk cities still stand. Within, a great many serpentfolk sleep in torpor in secluded vaults, with only a few cells awake to enact their schemes. In addition, a small number of serpentfolk settlements dot Golarion’s surface, most of them in humid, remote jungles, far-flung islands, or caverns close to the surface. It’s rare for such a settlement to number more than a few dozen serpentfolk. They rely primarily on slaves to build their power bases, to defend them, and to perform essentially all the practical functions of their society. This includes providing food, crafting goods, and tending to the serpentfolk’s every need. Zyss serpentfolk are megalomaniacal geniuses with dreams of returning to their place of dominance, though modern serpentfolk have few means of accomplishing this goal. Many of their plans hinge on resurrecting Ydersius, their decapitated god. His headless body still thrashes about, mindless, in the Darklands, waiting to be reunited with his lost skull. Serpentfolk numbers are so small that reclaiming their dominance seems a distant dream, especially since their reproduction is slow. Though a parent can birth a dozen young at once, the gestation period lasts up to a decade, and the likelihood that even one will be zyss is low. There’s no telling whether a child will be zyss or aapoph, regardless of parentage. A coveted zyss child is just as likely to arise from aapoph parents as from two zyss, and every serpentfolk colony has someone in charge of sorting the young, identifying the earliest signs of intelligence in them. Though the number of zyss is small in serpentfolk colonies, bringing in more zyss isn’t necessarily desirable. A serpentfolk conclave with just a few zyss is functional, but one with a large number becomes fractious. Cults and societies form, all pursuing their own passions and politics, with scheming and backstabbing running rampant. A powerful priest may be able to bring other zyss to heel, but many zyss question why a priest should be in charge if their god is dead. Zyss thrive on selfish desires for hedonistic pleasure and adulation. They feel no love for others, even their offspring. Thriving on decadence, they crave receiving expensive gifts, gorging themselves on massive meals, and pursing arts such as music, poetry, or sculpture. Even more academic hobbies, like the study of magic or warfare, take an artistic bent, like carefully designing colorful illusions or memorizing epic poems about renowned wars. Each zyss believes themself to have more refined tastes than their peers. Members Aapoph Serpentfolk (Creature 3), Bone Prophet (Creature 8), Coil Spy (Creature 4), Serpentfolk Granitescale (Creature 6), Serpentfolk Venom Caller (Creature 7), Zyss Serpentfolk (Creature 2) Evolving Times Granitescales are only one type of aapoph variant to arise in surface colonies, but all display intelligence somewhat greater than ordinary aapophs. Zyss serpentfolk are secretly concerned that their grip on their dull-witted aapoph brethren might slip. A cultural shift has begun to emerge in some colonies where the ruling zyss now assure aapophs they're valuable workers with a purpose to fill, rather than subservient chattel. Magaambyan Victims Zyss serpentfolk of the Mwangi Expanse have recently taken a keen interest in the activities of the Magaambya and its members throughout the region. Some Magaambyans far from the school have gone missing, often after uncharacteristically absconding with magical lore. While they may have been impersonated by serpentfolk, even more worrying is the possibility that the serpentfolk have discovered an arcane means of regaining their former dominance. Serpentfolk Magic Some serpentfolk might have entirely different innate spells. These alternative spells are typically illusions, enchantments, or divinations like dream message , enthrall , glibness , invisibility , mindlink , mind probe , mind reading , mislead , phantom pain , or zealous conviction . Aapoph serpentfolk lack innate spells. the Headless King Ydersius was defeated by an Azlanti heroine named Savith in the era before Earthfall, and now the so-called Headless King's body prowls aimlessly in the Darklands.

What Falls Will Rise The war between the humans of ancient Azlant and the serpentfolk of Sekamina waged on for years.

These revenants appear as humans come back after death to complete some task left undone before they can peacefully rest. Many are vengeful and murderous, but some are simply attempting to return to their former lives, like a shoemaker rising from the grave to mend his children's shoes, carry water, and chop firewood.

If the person answers, the vrykolakas then tries to hunt and slay them within 3 days. Others have an affinity for specific types of animals, always preferring to charm or possess them, or have an aversion to others. Unlike a [moroi vampire](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=97), however, for a vrykolakas these habits are merely sadistic games or personal preferences, not mystical compulsions.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature Family Group\">Vampire</title>\r\n\r\n**Related Families**\r\n[Vampire](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=97), [Vampire, Jiang-Shi](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=286), [Vampire, Nosferatu](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=273), [Vampire, Strigoi](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=314), [Vampire, Vetalarana](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=311)\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Creating a Vrykolakas</title>\r\n\r\nYou can turn an existing living creature into a vrykolakas using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. \n<ul><li>It gains the [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) and [vampire](/Traits.aspx?ID=242) traits, and it becomes evil. </li><li>Increase AC, attack modifiers, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. </li><li>Increase Speed by 10 feet or to 40 feet, whichever results in a higher Speed. </li><li>Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.</li></ul> \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Basic Vrykolakas Abilities</title> If the base creature becoming a vrykolakas has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=90) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91). You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vrykolakas' theme. All vrykolakas gain the following abilities. \n\n**[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)** \n\n**Swift Tracker** The vrykolakas moves at full Speed while [Tracking](/Actions.aspx?ID=66). \n\n**[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)** \n\n**Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145) \n\n**Feral Corruption** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> ([curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [possession](/Traits.aspx?ID=129)) **Trigger** The vrykolakas is reduced to 0 Hit Points, and an [animal](/Traits.aspx?ID=9) is within 100 feet; **Effect** Unlike most other undead, a vrykolakas isn't destroyed when it reaches 0 HP. Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet, which must attempt a Will save (use a high DC for the vrykolakas's level from the [Spell DC and Spell Attack Roll table](/Rules.aspx?ID=1020)). On a failure, the animal is possessed. This has the effects of the [_possession_](/Spells.aspx?ID=225) spell, but it lasts a number of days equal to the vrykolakas's level. This possession can't be [counteracted](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) with magic (though [_remove curse_](/Spells.aspx?ID=250) works against it normally).\n\n If the animal succeeds at its save, the vrykolakas can attempt to possess a different animal within 100 feet. If at any point an animal critically succeeds at its save or no animal is within 100 feet, the vrykolakas fails to possess anything and is destroyed.\n\n A vrykolakas possessing an animal seeks out its burial site (see Burial Site Bound below) immediately, burying itself there. While the vrykolakas is in this state of recovery, its animal host is [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), and beheading it destroys the vrykolakas and kills its host. Removing the curse destroys the vrykolakas and returns the animal to normal. After 1d4 days, if the vrykolakas hasn't been destroyed, the animal dies and the vrykolakas rises in a new body that's identical to its previous one, formed from the animal's remains. \n\n**Vrykolakas Vulnerabilities** Vrykolakas all have the following vulnerabilities. \n<ul><li>**Burial Site Bound** A vrykolakas is bound to the place of its death or interment. It must return to this location once per week and bury itself in the earth for 24 hours, during which time it is paralyzed and can be beheaded. If it is unable to return to this site, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and attempts to use Feral Corruption; if this host animal can't return to the burial site before the possession effect ends, the vrykolakas is destroyed and the animal host returns to normal. </li><li>**Vulnerable to Decapitation** A vrykolakas that is beheaded can't use its Feral Possession, and a beheaded corpse cannot rise as a vrykolakas.</li></ul>**Climb Speed** A vrykolakas gains a climb Speed equal to one-half its land Speed. \n\n**Claws** If the base creature had hands, it gains an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) trait. Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the [Strike Damage](/Rules.aspx?ID=1018) table. \n\n**Fangs** The teeth of the vrykolakas grow long, sharp, and deadly, granting it a fangs Strike: an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage and enables the use of its Drink Blood ability. Use the high damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table. \n\n**Drink Blood** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Requirements** The vrykolakas' last action was a successful fangs Strike; **Effect** The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10), and the vrykolakas regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.\n\n The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. \n\n**[Rend](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=30)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> The vrykolakas gains the Rend action with its claws.\n\n \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Vrykolakas Master Abilities</title> Particularly powerful vrykolakas can create spawn from the bodies of their victims and gain additional abilities, as detailed below. Creatures of 9th level or higher can become a vrykolakas master, while those of 12th level or higher who have survived for centuries might become a vrykolakas ancient. \n\n**Children of the Night** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) The presence of a vrykolakas master inspires savage creatures to crawl forth to do its bidding, including [rat swarms](/Monsters.aspx?ID=347), [warg](/Monsters.aspx?ID=402), [werewolves](/Monsters.aspx?ID=411), and similar creatures. The vrykolakas master can give telepathic orders to these creatures within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back. \n\n**Pestilential Aura** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=202), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) 5 feet. Creatures beginning their turn in the area while the vrykolakas is in its true form are exposed to [bubonic plague](/Diseases.aspx?ID=6). \n\n**Divine Innate Spells** The vrykolakas master can cast [_vampiric touch_](/Spells.aspx?ID=354) (heightened to half its level rounded up) and 3rd-level [fear](/Deities.aspx?ID=110) three times per day each as divine innate spells. It uses a high DC for its level. \n\n**Bubonic Plague** ([disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46)) **Saving Throw** Fortitude (use a high DC for the vrykolakas's level); **Onset** 1 day; **Stage 1** [fatigued](/Conditions.aspx?ID=15) (1 day); **Stage 2** [enfeebled 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=13) and fatigued (1 day); Stage 3 enfeebled 3, fatigued, and takes 1d6 [persistent bleed damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) every 1d20 minutes (1 day) \n\n**Change Shape** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=127), [transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) A vrykolakas master can transform into a form resembling the body it had in life, with the effects of [_humanoid form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=153) but with unlimited duration. It loses its fangs and claw Strikes but gains a +2 circumstance bonus to [Deception](/Skills.aspx?ID=5) checks to [Impersonate](/Actions.aspx?ID=46) in this form. \n\n**Create Spawn** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [downtime](/Traits.aspx?ID=49), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, a vrykolakas master can turn this creature into a [vrykolakas spawn](/Monsters.aspx?ID=842) by donating some of its own blood to the creature and burying it in earth for 3 nights. Such vrykolakas spawn are generally [friendly](/Conditions.aspx?ID=18) to the vrykolakas that created them, but they are not under its control and typically wander off on their own rampage within 1d6 days of their creation. **Dominate Animal** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) The vrykolakas can cast [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=87) at will as a divine innate spell that affects only animals. The save DC is a high DC for the vrykolakas's level, and a creature that succeeds is immune to that vrykolakas's Dominate Animal for 24 hours. Destroying the vrykolakas ends the effect, but reducing it to 0 HP does not. A dominated animal takes a –4 circumstance penalty to saving throws against the vrykolakas's Feral Possession. \n\n**Drink Blood** As a typical vrykolakas, but the creature is drained 2 instead of 1.","name":"Vampire, Vrykolakas","primary_source":"Bestiary 2","primary_source_raw":"Bestiary 2 pg. 275","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2020-05-27","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 275 <sup>2.0</sup>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nWicked and vengeful souls denied even the most basic burial rites can rise again as vrykolakas, blood-drinking and plague-bearing reanimated corpses. …\r\n</summary>","skill_mod":{},"source":["Bestiary 2"],"source_raw":["Bestiary 2 pg. 275"],"source_category":["Rulebooks"],"source_markdown":"[Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 275 <sup>2.0</sup>","speed":{},"summary":"Wicked and vengeful souls denied even the most basic burial rites can rise again as vrykolakas, blood-drinking and plague-bearing reanimated corpses. …","summary_markdown":"Wicked and vengeful souls denied even the most basic burial rites can rise again as vrykolakas, blood-drinking and plague-bearing reanimated corpses. …","text":" Vampire, Vrykolakas Source Bestiary 2 pg. 275 2.0 Wicked and vengeful souls denied even the most basic burial rites can rise again as vrykolakas, blood-drinking and plague-bearing reanimated corpses.

Vrykolakas Habits Most vrykolakas have curious affectations, such as a compulsion to knock on a door before entering or calling out the name of the person within. If the person answers, the vrykolakas then tries to hunt and slay them within 3 days. Others have an affinity for specific types of animals, always preferring to charm or possess them, or have an aversion to others. Unlike a moroi vampire, however, for a vrykolakas these habits are merely sadistic games or personal preferences, not mystical compulsions. Vampire Related Families Vampire, Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Vampire, Nosferatu, Vampire, Strigoi, Vampire, Vetalarana Creating a Vrykolakas You can turn an existing living creature into a vrykolakas using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and it becomes evil. Increase AC, attack modifiers, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase Speed by 10 feet or to 40 feet, whichever results in a higher Speed. Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Basic Vrykolakas Abilities If the base creature becoming a vrykolakas has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vrykolakas' theme. All vrykolakas gain the following abilities. Darkvision Swift Tracker The vrykolakas moves at full Speed while Tracking. Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep Feral Corruption Free Action (curse, divine, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, possession) Trigger The vrykolakas is reduced to 0 Hit Points, and an animal is within 100 feet; Effect Unlike most other undead, a vrykolakas isn't destroyed when it reaches 0 HP. Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet, which must attempt a Will save (use a high DC for the vrykolakas's level from the Spell DC and Spell Attack Roll table). On a failure, the animal is possessed. This has the effects of the possession spell, but it lasts a number of days equal to the vrykolakas's level. This possession can't be counteracted with magic (though remove curse works against it normally). If the animal succeeds at its save, the vrykolakas can attempt to possess a different animal within 100 feet. If at any point an animal critically succeeds at its save or no animal is within 100 feet, the vrykolakas fails to possess anything and is destroyed. A vrykolakas possessing an animal seeks out its burial site (see Burial Site Bound below) immediately, burying itself there. While the vrykolakas is in this state of recovery, its animal host is paralyzed, and beheading it destroys the vrykolakas and kills its host. Removing the curse destroys the vrykolakas and returns the animal to normal. After 1d4 days, if the vrykolakas hasn't been destroyed, the animal dies and the vrykolakas rises in a new body that's identical to its previous one, formed from the animal's remains. Vrykolakas Vulnerabilities Vrykolakas all have the following vulnerabilities. Burial Site Bound A vrykolakas is bound to the place of its death or interment. It must return to this location once per week and bury itself in the earth for 24 hours, during which time it is paralyzed and can be beheaded. If it is unable to return to this site, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and attempts to use Feral Corruption; if this host animal can't return to the burial site before the possession effect ends, the vrykolakas is destroyed and the animal host returns to normal. Vulnerable to Decapitation A vrykolakas that is beheaded can't use its Feral Possession, and a beheaded corpse cannot rise as a vrykolakas. Climb Speed A vrykolakas gains a climb Speed equal to one-half its land Speed. Claws If the base creature had hands, it gains an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the agile trait. Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table. Fangs The teeth of the vrykolakas grow long, sharp, and deadly, granting it a fangs Strike: an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage and enables the use of its Drink Blood ability. Use the high damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table. Drink Blood Single Action (divine, necromancy) Requirements The vrykolakas' last action was a successful fangs Strike; Effect The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes drained 1, and the vrykolakas regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so. The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. Rend Single Action The vrykolakas gains the Rend action with its claws. Vrykolakas Master Abilities Particularly powerful vrykolakas can create spawn from the bodies of their victims and gain additional abilities, as detailed below. Creatures of 9th level or higher can become a vrykolakas master, while those of 12th level or higher who have survived for centuries might become a vrykolakas ancient. Children of the Night (divine, enchantment, mental) The presence of a vrykolakas master inspires savage creatures to crawl forth to do its bidding, including rat swarms, warg, werewolves, and similar creatures. The vrykolakas master can give telepathic orders to these creatures within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back. Pestilential Aura (aura, divine, necromancy) 5 feet. Creatures beginning their turn in the area while the vrykolakas is in its true form are exposed to bubonic plague. Divine Innate Spells The vrykolakas master can cast vampiric touch (heightened to half its level rounded up) and 3rd-level fear three times per day each as divine innate spells. It uses a high DC for its level. Bubonic Plague (disease) Saving Throw Fortitude (use a high DC for the vrykolakas's level); Onset 1 day; Stage 1 fatigued (1 day); Stage 2 enfeebled 2 and fatigued (1 day); Stage 3 enfeebled 3, fatigued, and takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage every 1d20 minutes (1 day) Change Shape Single Action (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) A vrykolakas master can transform into a form resembling the body it had in life, with the effects of humanoid form but with unlimited duration. It loses its fangs and claw Strikes but gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Impersonate in this form. Create Spawn (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, a vrykolakas master can turn this creature into a vrykolakas spawn by donating some of its own blood to the creature and burying it in earth for 3 nights. Such vrykolakas spawn are generally friendly to the vrykolakas that created them, but they are not under its control and typically wander off on their own rampage within 1d6 days of their creation. Dominate Animal Single Action (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) The vrykolakas can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell that affects only animals. The save DC is a high DC for the vrykolakas's level, and a creature that succeeds is immune to that vrykolakas's Dominate Animal for 24 hours. Destroying the vrykolakas ends the effect, but reducing it to 0 HP does not. A dominated animal takes a –4 circumstance penalty to saving throws against the vrykolakas's Feral Possession. Drink Blood As a typical vrykolakas, but the creature is drained 2 instead of 1.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=159","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"creature-family-160","_score":4.226689,"_source":{"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Wolverine","creature_family_markdown":"Wolverine","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-160","image":["/Images/Monsters/Wolverine.png"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Wolverine](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=160)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 295 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\nFew creatures in the natural world can compare in ferocity to an angry wolverine.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Giant Wolverine](/Monsters.aspx?ID=863) (Creature 4), [Wolverine](/Monsters.aspx?ID=862) (Creature 2)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Territorial Beasts</title>\r\n\r\nWolverines are territorial animals and fiercely defend their kills, even from larger predators or when they're outnumbered.

It retains any spellcasting abilities it had in life, regardless of their origin, and gains the abilities listed below. You might need to adjust other abilities that conflict with the monster’s new theme as a worm that walks. \n\n**[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)** \n\n**[Tremorsense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=40)** 30 feet (imprecise) \n\n**Immunities** All worms that walk have immunity to disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, and unconscious. They also have the [swarm mind](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=36) ability, which makes them immune to [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) effects that target a specific number of creatures, though they are still subject to mental effects that affect all creatures in an area. \n\n**[All-Around Vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=1)** \n\n**Discorporate** When the worm that walks is reduced to 0 HP, it discorporates and the component worms that make up its body disperse in every direction. If even a single worm escapes, the worm that walks will eventually re-form using a process that typically takes 1d10 days.\n\n While the exact circumstances and surroundings determine how long the worm that walks’s foes have to dispatch the fleeing worms before they escape, usually its foes have only a single round. Typically, this requires the application of an area effect or [splash](/Traits.aspx?ID=150) weapon within 1 round to the space where the worm that walks collapsed. After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space, the character dealing the damage must attempt a DC 15 flat check. Each subsequent area or splash damage effect performed on the area reduces the DC of this flat check by 2, to a minimum of DC 5. If any of these flat checks succeed, none of the worms escape, and the worm that walks is destroyed permanently. At the GM’s discretion, clever means of trapping or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend the time allowed to finish off the worm that walks. \n\n**Tendril** Regardless of the creature’s former anatomy, it gains a tendril melee Strike with reach that deals [persistent piercing damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29) as it leaves biting worms on the target. If it had any [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) attacks, the damage dealt by its tendril should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks.

They arise as a result of necromantic rituals, especially violent deaths, or the sheer malevolent will of the deceased.\n\n As many types of wights exist as types of people from which they might be created. Hulking brutes, skittering sneaks, and cunning tinkers all make for different wights with different niches to fill. Environment, too, plays a part in determining a wight's special abilities and defenses. Frost wights, for instances, can be found in the parts of the world where exposure is a common end. Regardless, wights typically haunt burial grounds, catacombs, or other places of the dead. But their hunger is targeted toward the living—those individuals who remind them of the shackles of mortality and whom they feel compelled to “free” to the state of undeath.\n\n A single wight can wreak a lot of havoc if it is compelled to rise from its tomb. Because creatures slain by wights become wights as well, all it takes is a single wight and a handful of unlucky graveyard visitors to create a veritable horde of these undead. Thus, canny priests and adventurers know that the best solution to a wight problem is swift and total eradication. Care must be taken, though, to destroy wight spawn before attempting to destroy the parent wight, for spawn without a master gain the ability to create spawn of their own.\n\n Durable and sustained as they are by negative energy, wights can last in harsh environments without decaying the way some lesser undead do. They might dwell in high mountain passes, sealed passageways, or submerged in bogs or lakes for decades or even centuries before the passage of an unsuspecting traveler rouses them from their rest.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Cairn Wight](/Monsters.aspx?ID=859) (Creature 4), [Hunter Wight](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1915) (Creature 7), [Prowler Wight](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1916) (Creature 9), [Wight](/Monsters.aspx?ID=413) (Creature 3), [Wight](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3239) (Creature 3), [Wight Commander](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1917) (Creature 12)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Barrow Arsenals</title>\r\n\r\nIn addition to the wight presented here, many other varieties exist. For example, the covetous cairn wight—ritually created to eternally guard its own wealth or that of its master—haunts barrows, ossuaries, and mausoleums.

They arise as a result of necromantic rituals, especially violent deaths, or the sheer malevolent will of the deceased. As many types of wights exist as types of people from which they might be created. Hulking brutes, skittering sneaks, and cunning tinkers all make for different wights with different niches to fill. Environment, too, plays a part in determining a wight's special abilities and defenses. Frost wights, for instances, can be found in the parts of the world where exposure is a common end. Regardless, wights typically haunt burial grounds, catacombs, or other places of the dead. But their hunger is targeted toward the living—those individuals who remind them of the shackles of mortality and whom they feel compelled to “free” to the state of undeath. A single wight can wreak a lot of havoc if it is compelled to rise from its tomb. Because creatures slain by wights become wights as well, all it takes is a single wight and a handful of unlucky graveyard visitors to create a veritable horde of these undead. Thus, canny priests and adventurers know that the best solution to a wight problem is swift and total eradication. Care must be taken, though, to destroy wight spawn before attempting to destroy the parent wight, for spawn without a master gain the ability to create spawn of their own. Durable and sustained as they are by negative energy, wights can last in harsh environments without decaying the way some lesser undead do. They might dwell in high mountain passes, sealed passageways, or submerged in bogs or lakes for decades or even centuries before the passage of an unsuspecting traveler rouses them from their rest.

For example, the covetous cairn wight—ritually created to eternally guard its own wealth or that of its master—haunts barrows, ossuaries, and mausoleums. Hunter wights arm themselves with bows and create arrowheads from bone shards snapped off their own ribs. Wights And Weaponry For the rank-and-file wight, only the scrape of blackened fingernails steals the essence of life. Many stronger wights bind to armaments, either through the ritual that raised them or a sentimental attachment to a weapon they wielded. Not only are these weapons more versatile, but deploying them can surprise foes accustomed to the limits of average wights.

Red dragons see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind. With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of blistering flame, this is no haughty boast in their eyes—only unquestioned fact.\n\n  Red dragons don't deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon's security.\n\n  Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements. They want the world to see them in their rightful place as powerful tyrants, and they delight in threatening all other creatures. They have no qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing to complete their goals—or simply intimidating others through a public display of brutality and dominance.\n\n  As legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magnificence of their hoards of gold.

Red dragons see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind. With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of blistering flame, this is no haughty boast in their eyes—only unquestioned fact. Red dragons don't deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon's security. Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements. They want the world to see them in their rightful place as powerful tyrants, and they delight in threatening all other creatures. They have no qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing to complete their goals—or simply intimidating others through a public display of brutality and dominance. As legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magnificence of their hoards of gold.

Their beauty is a source of great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered and prone to finding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions.\n\n  Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance.

Their beauty is a source of great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered and prone to finding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions. Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon. Although crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly.

A gibtas often forms a bond with a single other creature—usually, a more powerful aberration— and serves this master loyally, if erratically. Creatures who keep a gibtas as a pet or guard soon learn to keep it away from any important possessions they don't want spattered with acid. Members Gibtanius (Creature 8), Gibtas Bounder (Creature 5), Gibtas Spawn Swarm (Creature 6) Gibtas Companions A gibtas can make for an unusual animal companion, with the GM's permission. Use the statistics for a bear animal companion, except the companion has the rare trait, is an aberration rather than an animal, has darkvision rather than low-light vision, and gains the gibtas bounder's Bouncing Slam as an advanced maneuver instead of Bear Hug. Wild Gibtases In the wild, gibtases are scavenger creatures, avoiding much larger and more powerful predators while feeding off abandoned scraps. This limits their consumption-based reproduction. By spawning hundreds of offspring at once during times of plentiful food, they ensure the propagation of their species only during times of plenty.

Entangling Long, stringy hair clings to the beheaded's scalp. Its Strikes gain the Grab ability. Fiendish (aura, divine, emotion, fear, mental, necromancy) 30 feet. The beheaded has a twisted, unsettling countenance. Foes that begin their turn in the area must succeed at a Will save or be frightened 1. Giant A beheaded created from the head of a giant is a Medium creature, gaining 2 levels and one or more additional beheaded abilities. Alternate Beheaded Abilities Source Book of the Dead pg. 74 Lifesense The beheaded has imprecise lifesense out to 60 feet. Whispering (aura, emotion, fear, mental, necromancy) 30 feet. The beheaded constantly whispers twisted incantations in unknown languages secret and foul. Foes that enter or begin their turn in the area must succeed at a Will save or be stupefied 1. The aura uses the moderate DC for the beheaded's level. Furious Headbutt Single Action Frequency once per round; Effect The beheaded makes a wild Strike, taking a –2 penalty to its AC until the end of its next turn.

Backfire : The clockwork rolls a DC 5 flat check at the start of each of its turns. On a failure, it backfires, dealing 2d6 fire damage in a 15-foot cone, including to itself (basic Reflex save at the standard DC for its level), and is slowed 1 this turn. Damaged Propulsion : The clockwork loses 1d4 hours of operational time at the end of each of its turns. Loose Screws : When damaged, the clockwork attempts a DC 5 flat check. On a failure, a plate of its armor falls loose. It takes a status penalty to AC equal to the number of lost plates (up to –4). Versatile Designs Most clockwork builders design their mechanical minions to perform a single specific task, as in the case of the clockwork door warden or clockwork disposer. Though these constructs' intended functions are typically limited, creative owners can find workarounds or loopholes to exploit, effectively turning their single-purpose clockwork into a versatile guardian or servant. Of course, nearly every clockwork is pre-programmed to defend itself against foes, a function which typically requires no special action on the clockwork's part. Winding Routines Maintaining a group of clockworks that are meant to operate on a regular basis takes planning and attention. A cadre of clockwork soldiers set to patrol a location needs to be regularly wound. Typically, one or more servants are assigned to wind all the clockworks serving in one place at a standard time.

These eccentric little fey want nothing more than to explore the many wonders of the world for their own pleasure. Born of magical trees in seed pods that float hundreds of miles on the wind, gathlains are a bizarre mix of flesh and flora. Sprigs of mistletoe bloom from their back and form a delicate pair of wings. They enjoy adorning themselves with oddities found on their journeys, such as beads, pieces of fine cloth, and bits of armor. The fey see these accessories as trophies, proof of their travels, and mementos of their adventures. The typical gathlain is only 2 feet tall, but their small size doesn't deter them from seeking out and exploring potentially dangerous places. They sometimes even use their size to their advantage, squeezing through tight spaces that most would never be able to fit through.

Members Angheuvore Flesh-Gnawer (Creature 2), Etioling Blightmage (Creature 10), Gurgist Mauler (Creature 6), Jitterbone Contortionist (Creature 4), Lifeleecher Brawler (Creature 8), Relictner Eroder (Creature 12), Shadern Immolator (Creature 1) Fun and Games Many mortics favor games to pass the time. Jitterbones compete in community “bone churns” to see who can contort themselves into the most awkward shapes or fit through the smallest spaces. Shadern enjoy “burn-scream,” a deadly game pitting contenders against one another to see who makes the funniest sounds while being immolated. Relictners coax passersby into visiting their homes before they hunt their victims through a gauntlet of traps. Home Sweet Home Most gurgists are survivors from Roslar's Coffer or Vigil who fled together to Nirmathas or Ustalav, where they've since built their own insular communities. Some fled to Absalom but struggle to fit in; most camp in the Cairnlands or form gangs in the city's slums. Shaderns are typically found in Belkzen, Oprak, and Isger, living among goblin tribes. Jitterbones are common in the River Kingdoms and Ustalav, living in rural, all-jitterbone communities. Relictners are widely spread, for they live individually and build their lairs near trade routes, fabled ruins, and other storied locales. They avoid dwarves and refuse to enter the Five Kings Mountains. Most mortics were created inadvertently by the rise of the Whispering Tyrant—either by the Radiant Fire or through the corruption spreading from the Gravelands and Isle of Terror. Other Mortics The mortics presented here are four of the most prevalent variations. Others—such as relictner dwarves, shadern goblins, and jitterbone halflings—are also common.

In order to complete the natural spiritual cycle and become judged so they can continue to the afterlife, a phantom must simply find a way back into the River of Souls.

Siktemporas usually isolate themselves on the Dimension of Time in mindscapes infused with the emotion that created them, but some travel to other planes. These wanderers long to indulge in more of their core emotion or to engender more of that feeling, thus perpetuating their own kind. Members Anguish Siktempora (Creature 13), Hatred Siktempora (Creature 18), Love Siktempora (Creature 16), Misery Siktempora (Creature 12), Triumph Siktempora (Creature 14) Other Siktemporas Almost any intense emotion that exists over time can give birth to a siktempora. What few reports exist of the Dimension of Time give references to siktemporas of anger, joy, and whimsy, while ancient tales tell of creatures similar to siktemporas that hold sway over dedication and discovery, awe and infatuation, or pity and panic. Some sages even discuss the existence of hybrid siktemporas, created by epoch events that inspired two different emotions in equal intensity Siktempora Lairs While many siktemporas on the Material Plane seek out the emotions that built them with utmost fervor, after eons of emotional intensity, some claim an area for their respite. A love siktempora might live in the attic of a coffee shop whose employees are skilled matchmakers, while a hatred siktempora might dwell beneath the floorboards of a vindictive organization that seeks to spread injustice. Siktempora Treasures Siktemporas hold few practical items on them, but they regularly hoard items associated with the events that spawned them. A misery siktempora created by the pain of a mass killing might hunt the perpetrators down and carry the weapon used, while a love siktempora might hold the series of love letters that gave birth to them close to their chests ","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=259","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"creature-family-260","_score":4.226689,"_source":{"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Skelm","creature_family_markdown":"Skelm","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-260","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Skelm](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=260)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 238\n\nRage-filled skelms are drawn to any settlement with more than a few hundred souls.

If even a single rat reaches the coffin, the nosferatu can recover. A nosferatu regains their strength through resting in earth taken from the grave of a creature who died of plague. If their body rests in their earth-filled coffin for 1 hour, the nosferatu gains 1 HP, after which their fast healing begins to function normally.

On a success, the creature becomes [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10), and the nosferatu regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the nosferatu, but increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A nosferatu can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no HP from doing so.<br /> The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week.

Monster of Legend The word nosferatu has appeared in print since the mid-18th century, purported by Western Europeans to be a Romanian word for vampire, inspiring some of horror fiction's best writers. No clear etymology exists, and while it's unknown whether the word's roots are actually Romanian, the vampire itself is an enduring element of Romanian folklore. Vampire Related Families Vampire, Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Vampire, Strigoi, Vampire, Vetalarana, Vampire, Vrykolakas Creating a Nosferatu You can turn an existing living creature into a nosferatu using the following steps. A creature below 8th level isn't significant enough to be a nosferatu and should likely be a regular vampire instead. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and it becomes evil. Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase Speed by 5 feet or to 30 feet, whichever results in a higher Speed. Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Reduce HP by the amount listed on the table. The nosferatu gains fast healing and resistance to physical damage (except magical wood) as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the nosferatu has fewer HP. Starting Level HP Decrease Fast Healing/Resistance 8-14 -40 10 15+ -60 15 Basic Nosferatu Abilities If the base creature becoming a nosferatu has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the nosferatu's theme. All nosferatus gain the following abilities. Darkvision Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep Nosferatu Vulnerabilities Revulsion A nosferatu can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raise a Shield). If the nosferatu involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the fleeing condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a nosferatu can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). Stake A magical wooden stake (such as one affected by a weapon potency rune, magic weapon , or similar magic) driven through the nosferatu's heart drops the nosferatu to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a nosferatu requires 3 actions and works only if the nosferatu is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the nosferatu can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the nosferatu's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the nosferatu is destroyed. Sunlight If exposed to direct sunlight, a nosferatu immediately becomes slowed 1. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the nosferatu ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight. If the nosferatu loses all their actions in this way, they're destroyed. Plagued Coffin Restoration (divine, necromancy, negative) Unlike other undead, a nosferatu isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they disperse into an immense number of individual rats heading in every direction in an attempt to return to their coffin. If even a single rat reaches the coffin, the nosferatu can recover. A nosferatu regains their strength through resting in earth taken from the grave of a creature who died of plague. If their body rests in their earth-filled coffin for 1 hour, the nosferatu gains 1 HP, after which their fast healing begins to function normally. If the coffin doesn't contain this plagued grave dirt, they instead need to rest in their coffin for 1 day before they gain 1 HP and regain their fast healing. Change Shape Single Action (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The nosferatu transforms into a swarm of pale-gray rats. They gain a land Speed of 30 feet and a climb Speed of 10 feet, and they become Large. Each enemy in the swarm's space takes 2d10 piercing damage and must attempt a basic Reflex save with a high DC for the creature's level. A creature that fails its save is exposed to plague of ancients (see below). Command Thrall Free Action (auditory, divine, mental) Requirements One of the nosferatu's thralls is present and can hear the nosferatu; Effect The nosferatu gives a single command to one of their thralls, which the thrall follows to the best of its ability during its next turn. Divine Innate Spells The nosferatu can cast telekinetic haul (heightened to half their level rounded up) three times per day as a divine innate spell. They use a high DC for their level. Plague of Ancients (disease, virulent) Saving Throw Fortitude (use a high DC for the nosferatu's level); Onset 1 day; Stage 1 drained 1 (1 day); Stage 2 drained 2 and enfeebled 2 (1 day); Stage 3 doomed 1, drained 3, and enfeebled 3 (1 day); Stage 4 doomed 2, drained 3, and enfeebled 3 (1 day); Stage 5 unconscious (1 day); Stage 6 death Dominate Two Actions (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The nosferatu can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses a high DC for the nosferatu's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that nosferatu's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the nosferatu ends the domination, but merely reducing the nosferatu to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell. Drink Blood Single Action (divine, necromancy) Requirements The nosferatu's last action was a successful fangs Strike; Effect The nosferatu sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes drained 1, and the nosferatu regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the nosferatu, but increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A nosferatu can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no HP from doing so. The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. Nosferatu Overlord Abilities A truly primeval nosferatu can gain extraordinary powers over their foes. Creatures must have lived for millennia and be 14th level or higher to become a nosferatu overlord. Air of Sickness (aura) 30 feet. A creature entering or starting its turn in the aura must attempt a Fortitude save with a moderate DC for the nosferatu's level. On a failure, the creature is sickened 1 and takes a –2 status penalty to saves made to resist diseases and remove the sickened condition for 1 hour. Divine Innate Spells As nosferatu, but they can also cast vampiric exsanguination twice per day as a divine innate spell. Paralytic Fear Free Action (divine, emotion, fear, incapacitation, mental) Requirements The nosferatu overlord's last action was a successful claw Strike; Effect The nosferatu drags the target of the Strike close and freezes its mind in terror. The target must attempt a Will save with a moderate DC for the nosferatu's level. Critical Success The target is unaffected. Success The target is immobilized by fear until the end of the nosferatu's next turn. Failure The target is restrained and takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its Fortitude DC against the nosferatu's Drink Blood ability until the end of the nosferatu's next turn. Critical Failure As failure, and the target is frightened 2. Nosferatu Thrall Abilities Any creature under a nosferatu's thrall gains the following abilities. Fast Healing A nosferatu thrall gains fast healing 5 from being sustained by their master's blood. Weaknesses The strain of being controlled wears on the nosferatu thrall's mind, giving them weakness 10 to mental damage. Mindbound (divine, enchantment) A nosferatu master exerts a fierce hold over their thrall's mind. If any creature other than the thrall's master targets them with an effect that would give them the controlled condition, the thrall's master rolls a counteract check against it using their Dominate DC - 10 as the counteract check modifier. Mortal Shield Reaction Trigger The thrall's master would take damage from a Strike or spell attack and is in an adjacent square; Effect The thrall throws themself in front of their master, taking half the damage of the attack (before applying any weaknesses or resistances). The thrall's master takes the remaining damage, applying any weaknesses or resistances as normal. Rally Reaction Trigger The thrall ends their turn more than 30 feet away from their master; Effect The thrall Strides up to their Speed toward their master.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=273","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"creature-family-274","_score":4.226689,"_source":{"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Vanara","creature_family_markdown":"Vanara","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-274","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Vanara](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=274)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 286\n\nVanaras are monkey-like humanoids who dwell in treetop villages high in the canopies of lush jungles and verdant forests.

These abilities are the reason the jiang-shi has less HP.</li></ul> <table class =\"inner\"> <tr><td>**Starting Level**</td><td>**HP Decrease**</td><td>**Fast Healing/Resistance**</td></tr> <tr><td>3-4</td><td>–20</td><td>5</td></tr> <tr><td>5-7</td><td>–30</td><td>7</td></tr> <tr><td>8-14</td><td>–40</td><td>10</td></tr> <tr><td>15+</td><td>–60</td><td>15</td></tr></table> \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Basic Jiang-Shi Abilities</title> If the base creature becoming a jiang-shi has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=90) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91). You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the jiang-shi's theme. All jiang-shi gain the following abilities. \n\n**[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)** \n\n**Breathsense** 60 feet ([precise](/Rules.aspx?ID=411)). A jiang-shi can't perceive living creatures beyond 5 feet except with their breathsense. A living creature within the listed range who holds its breath is invisible to the jiang-shi for as long as it hold its breath. To hold its breath in this way, a creature must have one hand free to fully plug its nose or cover its mouth. (Refer to [Drowning and Suffocation](/Rules.aspx?ID=468) for the full rules on holding breath.) \n\n**[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)** \n\n**Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145), [prone](/Conditions.aspx?ID=31) \n\n**One More Breath** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118)); Unlike other undead, a jiang-shi isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38) and awaken in 1 minute with 1 Hit Point. Scattering at least 1 Bulk of glutinous rice or hen eggs on an unconscious jiang-shi destroys them permanently. If the jiang-shi was reduced to 0 HP by an attack from a weapon made of [darkwood](/Equipment.aspx?ID=273), they're destroyed immediately \n\n**Jiang-shi Vulnerabilities** All jiang-shi possess the following vulnerabilities.\n<ul><li>**Revulsion** A jiang-shi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or the sound of ringing handbells. A creature can Interact with a mirror or handbell to brandish or ring that item for 1 round (similar to [Raising a Shield](/Actions.aspx?ID=98)). If the jiang-shi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they are 10 feet or farther from the object. After 1 round of being exposed to the object of their revulsion, a jiang-shi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li><li>**Bitter Epiphany** A jiang-shi is afflicted by severe melancholia when reminded of their debased nature and the truth of their existential disconnection from living beings. When a jiang-shi sees an altar with at least 1 Bulk of food offerings to ancestor spirits, they must attempt a DC 25 Will save. They are then temporarily immune to bitter epiphany for 1 minute.<br /> **Critical Success** The jiang-shi is unaffected.<br /> **Success** The jiang-shi is [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) for 1 round.<br /> **Failure** The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 for 1 minute.<br /> **Critical Failure** The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 and [confused](/Conditions.aspx?ID=5) for 1 minute. </li></ul>**Warped Fulu** The jiang-shi has corrupted the fulu attached to their brow. The jiang-shi is immune to spells cast from a magic item without expending a spell slot, such as from a scroll or wand. A creature can [Steal](/Actions.aspx?ID=68) a jiang-shi's fulu to remove it, rolling against the jiang-shi's Perception DC. This immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to these effects. If a creature then destroys a jiang-shi's removed fulu with an Interact action, the jiang-shi also loses their [fast healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=15) ability. A jiang-shi can create a replacement fulu by spending 1 uninterrupted hour inscribing a strip of paper (or similar) with a writing instrument. \n\n**Rigor Mortis** The jiang-shi ignores difficult terrain and effects that would render it [prone](/Conditions.aspx?ID=31).

Though similar to other vampires—they are undead, they drain vital energy from the living, and they can be slain only in specific ways—jiang-shi feast upon the breath of the living, also known as qi or ki, instead of blood. While they possess unique powers, including their magic-deflecting paper fulus, extraordinary jumping ability, and immunity to sunlight, jiang-shi also possess unique vulnerabilities, such as the inability to see living creatures save through breathsense, a revulsion to bells and mirrors, and near-stupefying melancholia. Thankfully, most jiang-shi can't create vampiric spawn. Members Minister Of Tumult (Creature 14), Minister Of Tumult (Creature 14), Provincial Jiang-Shi (Creature 11), Provincial Jiang-Shi (Creature 11) Dreamers of the Dark Jiang-shi typically arise from priests or holy workers who have died but chose to make their way back from the afterlife. While in a state of repose, a jiang-shi is haunted by dream visions of the netherworld. Many recall endless privations and instinctively seek to share their agonies while awake. Some recall humiliation and swear none shall master them again. A few even glimpse the multiverse's secrets and plot to drain the heavens dry. Hierarchies of Breath and Death Unlike their blood-drinking cousins, jiang-shi subsist on mortals' breath and vitality in the form of qi, also known in some regions as ki. As a jiang-shi inhales more qi, it becomes stronger in body and mind. A truly gluttonous jiang-shi becomes even more powerful and attains a higher status than its peers. Such ancient vampires are known as “ministers,” and they seek to feast on only the most rarefied qi of the cosmos. Jiang-Shi and Fulus A typical Tian exorcism for a jiang-shi involves the subdual of the vampire followed by a lengthy prayer to Pharasma. The exorcist then affixes a fulu charm upon the jiang-shi's brow, an object believed to ease the undead's eternal nightmares. Scorned by Heaven and Earth Jiang-shi crave qi, but are also repelled by harmonious arrangements of qi, such as that which occurs in rice, hen eggs, mirrors, and certain types of wood. Vampire Related Families Vampire, Vampire, Nosferatu, Vampire, Strigoi, Vampire, Vetalarana, Vampire, Vrykolakas Creating a Jiang-Shi While it's best to create a jiang-shi from scratch, you can turn an existing living creature into a jiang-shi using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually becomes evil. Increase the creature's AC, attack modifiers, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Reduce the creature's Speed by 10 feet, to a minimum of 15 feet. Increase the creature's damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Reduce the creature's HP by the amount listed on the table. The jiang-shi gains fast healing and resistance to physical damage (except darkwood) as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the jiang-shi has less HP. Starting Level HP Decrease Fast Healing/Resistance 3-4 –20 5 5-7 –30 7 8-14 –40 10 15+ –60 15 Basic Jiang-Shi Abilities If the base creature becoming a jiang-shi has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the jiang-shi's theme. All jiang-shi gain the following abilities. Darkvision Breathsense 60 feet (precise). A jiang-shi can't perceive living creatures beyond 5 feet except with their breathsense. A living creature within the listed range who holds its breath is invisible to the jiang-shi for as long as it hold its breath. To hold its breath in this way, a creature must have one hand free to fully plug its nose or cover its mouth. (Refer to Drowning and Suffocation for the full rules on holding breath.) Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep, prone One More Breath (divine, necromancy, negative); Unlike other undead, a jiang-shi isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall unconscious and awaken in 1 minute with 1 Hit Point. Scattering at least 1 Bulk of glutinous rice or hen eggs on an unconscious jiang-shi destroys them permanently. If the jiang-shi was reduced to 0 HP by an attack from a weapon made of darkwood, they're destroyed immediately Jiang-shi Vulnerabilities All jiang-shi possess the following vulnerabilities. Revulsion A jiang-shi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or the sound of ringing handbells. A creature can Interact with a mirror or handbell to brandish or ring that item for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the jiang-shi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the fleeing condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they are 10 feet or farther from the object. After 1 round of being exposed to the object of their revulsion, a jiang-shi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). Bitter Epiphany A jiang-shi is afflicted by severe melancholia when reminded of their debased nature and the truth of their existential disconnection from living beings. When a jiang-shi sees an altar with at least 1 Bulk of food offerings to ancestor spirits, they must attempt a DC 25 Will save. They are then temporarily immune to bitter epiphany for 1 minute. Critical Success The jiang-shi is unaffected. Success The jiang-shi is stupefied 1 for 1 round. Failure The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 for 1 minute. Critical Failure The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 and confused for 1 minute. Warped Fulu The jiang-shi has corrupted the fulu attached to their brow. The jiang-shi is immune to spells cast from a magic item without expending a spell slot, such as from a scroll or wand. A creature can Steal a jiang-shi's fulu to remove it, rolling against the jiang-shi's Perception DC. This immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to these effects. If a creature then destroys a jiang-shi's removed fulu with an Interact action, the jiang-shi also loses their fast healing ability. A jiang-shi can create a replacement fulu by spending 1 uninterrupted hour inscribing a strip of paper (or similar) with a writing instrument. Rigor Mortis The jiang-shi ignores difficult terrain and effects that would render it prone. A jiang-shi can't take the Drop Prone action. When a jiang-shi Leap, it doesn't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by move actions, such as Attacks of Opportunity. Claws If the base creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow to terrible proportions, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage, has the agile trait, and can Grab. Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table. Drain Qi Single Action (divine, necromancy) Requirement A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the jiang-shi's reach; Effect The jiang-shi drains the victim's life energy, or qi, through their breath. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is drained 1 and the jiang-shi regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Draining qi from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the jiang-shi but increases the victim's drained condition value by 1. If the victim has the ability to cast ki spells, it can spend 1 Focus Point to avoid becoming drained. This protects it only from the current attack, not from subsequent attempts to Drain Qi. A victim's drained condition value decreases by 1 every week. If the creature restricts their diet to glutinous rice for at least 1 day and spends 10 minutes dancing, jogging, or otherwise engaging in vigorous physical activity by succeeding at a DC 25 Athletics check, it reduces its drained condition by 1.

A creature below level 13 is not significant enough to become a minister—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular jiang-shi or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 13 before becoming a minister.

Distant Steps When the jiang-shi Leaps, they can add 10 feet to the horizontal and/or vertical distance they move without affecting the Leap DC. The jiang-shi can stand and walk on water and other solid or liquid surfaces that wouldn't normally support their weight.

If the armor is donned by one of the Black Prince's descendants, the Inner Sea will be beset by a terrible villain indeed. \r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Other Powers</title>\r\n\r\nYou can use the alternate abilities as examples to create new powers reflecting a graveknight's personality or history, or even swap out more than one power.

These are usually the armors of high-level graveknights, and their destruction steps are tied to the creation of the graveknight. For example, a specific graveknight armor can't be destroyed until it's struck by a descendant of the person that originally felled the graveknight in battle before their transformation.\r\n</aside>\n\n<title level=\"2\">Creating Graveknights</title>\r\n\r\nYou can turn an existing, living creature into a graveknight by completing the following steps. It's best to build a graveknight from scratch, but if you don't have the time, simply apply the template. A creature should be at least level 5 before being converted to a graveknight.<br /> Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. \n<ul><li>Increase its attack rolls, AC, saving throws, Perception, and skills by 1, its HP by 5, and its Strike damage by 1.</li></ul> \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Graveknight Abilities</title> A graveknight gains the [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) and graveknight traits, and its alignment is usually adjusted to evil. It loses any abilities that come from it being a living creature and any traits that represent its life, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=90) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91).<br /> **[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)**<br /> **[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)**<br /> **Rejuvenation** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) When a graveknight is destroyed, its armor rebuilds its body over the course of 1d10 days—or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host (see Graveknight Armor, below). If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts. A graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor (such as with disintegrate), transporting it to the Positive Energy Plane, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano.<br /> **Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), plus one energy type (the same chosen for ruinous weapons below).<br /> **Sacrilegious Aura** ([abjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=2), [aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), <t>evil) 30 feet. When a creature in the aura uses a [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128) spell or ability, the graveknight automatically attempts to [counteract](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) it, with the listed counteract modifier.<br /> **Devastating Blast** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65)) The graveknight unleashes a 30-foot cone of energy. Creatures in the area take 1d12 damage, plus an additional 1d12 damage for every two levels the graveknight has ([basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save). The graveknight can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. This energy damage is of the same type as that of its ruinous weapons (see below); Devastating Blast gains the associated energy trait.<br /> **Phantom Mount** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33), [summon](/Traits.aspx?ID=154)) The graveknight summons a supernatural mount as per [_phantom steed_](/Spells.aspx?ID=221), heightened to a level equal to half the graveknight's level. Unlike _phantom steed_, the steed's AC and saving throw bonuses are all 4 lower than the graveknight's, and the steed has one-third the graveknight's Hit Points (rounded down). If the steed is destroyed, the graveknight must wait 1 hour before using this ability again.<br /> **Ruinous Weapons** At the time of its creation, a graveknight chooses one of the following energy types that was relevant to its life or death: [acid](/Traits.aspx?ID=3), [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27), [electricity](/Traits.aspx?ID=56), or [fire](/Traits.aspx?ID=72). Any weapon the graveknight wields gains the effects of the [_corrosive_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=292), [_frost_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=296), [_shock_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=303), or [_flaming_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=295) weapon rune, respectively, in addition to a _+1 [striking](/Equipment.aspx?ID=280)_ weapon rune. If the graveknight is 14th level or higher, its weapons instead gain the effects of the greater versions of both of these runes.<br /> **Weapon Master** The graveknight has access to the [critical specialization effects](/Rules.aspx?ID=235) of any weapons it wields. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Alternate Graveknight Abilities</title> You can create a more unusual graveknight by substituting one of their  abilities (except for darkvision, negative healing, rejuvenation, or immunities) with one of the following.<br />  \n\n### Bestiary\n**Betrayed Revivification** The graveknight died after being deeply betrayed. Instead of being immune to a type of energy damage, it is immune to [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) damage, its weapons deal 1d6 additional mental damage, and its Devastating Blast deals mental damage with a Will saving throw instead of Reflex.<br /> **Create Grave Squire** The graveknight can gift a piece of its armor to a willing ally, which becomes its grave squire. The graveknight can communicate telepathically with its squire at any distance, see through the squire's senses, and cast [_suggestion_](/Spells.aspx?ID=315) as a divine innate spell through the telepathic link at will; the squire treats its degree of success as one step worse. If the graveknight's main armor is destroyed, the squire's piece expands to cover the squire's body over 1d10 days, after which point it becomes the graveknight's new body. The graveknight can have only one squire at a time, and must recover the gifted piece of armor if it wishes to create a new squire.<br /> **Dark Deliverance** The graveknight has positive resistance equal to its level. \n\n### Pathfinder #172: Secrets of the Temple City\n**Channel Magic** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> The graveknight redirects magical energies through its armor, allowing it to deliver magic through an attack. The graveknight Casts a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into an attack instead. The graveknight then makes a melee Strike with a weapon or [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=199) attack. The spell is coupled with the attack, using the attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for the graveknight's multiple attack penalty but doesn't apply the penalty until after it's completed Channeling Magic. The graveknight can't use Channel Magic again for 1d4 rounds.\n\n### Book Of The Dead\n <br /> **Clutching Armor** <actions string=\"Reaction\" /> ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) **Trigger** A creature attempts to move away from the graveknight; **Effect** The graveknight's armor animates and attempts to Grab the triggering creature. It makes an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check to [Grapple](/Actions.aspx?ID=35) using the graveknight's Athletics modifier – 2. The armor can continue to Grapple the creature normally. Since the armor is grappling the creature, the graveknight doesn't need a free hand to do so.<br />**Eager for Battle** ([fortune](/Traits.aspx?ID=76)) When the graveknight rolls initiative, they roll twice and take the better result. They're [quickened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=32) during their first round after rolling initiative and can use this extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike.<br /> **Empty Save for Dust** The graveknight's armor contains nothing more than swirling dust that puffs out from joints in their armor. A living creature that touches or is touched by the graveknight (including one hit by the graveknight's fist Strike) must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or become contaminated with the dust. While contaminated, the targeted creature is [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) and gains weakness to the graveknight's energy damage equal to half the graveknight's level. The contamination ends after 1 minute or when the creature is doused with water, whichever occurs first. <br />**Graveknight's Shield** ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) The graveknight's curse extends to their shield, or the graveknight's armor uses a portion of itself to produce a shield. The graveknight has a shield that uses the statistics of a [_sturdy shield_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=327) of a level no higher than the graveknight's level – 1. The shield is quasi-independent of the graveknight and automatically protects the graveknight from harm. When the shield is raised, it automatically uses [Shield Block](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=32) to reduce the damage of the first attack against the graveknight each round without the graveknight needing to spend their reaction to do so. The shield automatically rejuvenates with the rest of the graveknight and must be destroyed in the same manner as the graveknight's armor.<br />**Portentous Glare** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) 30 feet. The graveknight's visage is one of overwhelming menace. When a creature ends its turn in the aura, it must attempt a Will saving throw. A creature that fails is [doomed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=9) (or doomed 1 and [frightened 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19) on a critical failure). The graveknight can activate or deactivate the aura by using an Interact action to open or close their helmet visor.\n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Graveknight Armor</title> Wearing graveknight armor is very risky, for the graveknight's essence rapidly parasitizes the new wearer, accelerating the graveknight's rejuvenation. This agonizing transformation inevitably kills the host, transforming their flesh into the graveknight's new body. Removing the curse allows a character to remove the armor, but if it ever wears the armor again, the curse returns. If the wearer dies from another cause while wearing the armor, or if the graveknight's rejuvenation completes before the wearer dies from the curse, the wearer immediately progresses to stage 3.<br /> **Graveknight's Curse** ([arcane](/Traits.aspx?ID=11), [curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) This curse affects anyone who wears a graveknight's armor for at least 1 hour. **Saving Throw** Will save; **Onset** 1 hour; **Stage 1** doomed 1 and cannot remove the armor (1 day); **Stage 2** doomed 2, hampered 10, and cannot remove the armor (1 day); **Stage 3** dies and transforms into the armor's graveknight.","name":"Graveknight","primary_source":"Pathfinder #172: Secrets of the Temple City","primary_source_raw":"Pathfinder #172: Secrets of the Temple City pg. 82","primary_source_category":"Adventure Paths","primary_source_group":"Strength of Thousands","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2021-10-13","remaster_id":["creature-family-423"],"resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Pathfinder #172: Secrets of the Temple City](/Sources.aspx?ID=102) pg. 82\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nWhen a fearsome combatant falls in battle, the warrior's vengeful spirit can sometimes fuse with their armor, creating a graveknight.

Members Graveknight (Creature 10), Graveknight Captain (Creature 6), Graveknight Champion (Creature 15), Graveknight Warmaster (Creature 14) Arts of War Graveknights don't arise from mere soldiers but from great tacticians who've won countless engagements. Often, they were once their land's mightiest general or most decorated war hero. This means graveknights don't just rush into a toe-to-toe melee. They've studied the land (often with the experienced and unrelenting gaze only the undead can bring to bear) and engineered troop movements, earthworks, and traps to ensure victory. They usually have reinforcements ready to deploy and redundant contingencies in place. Just as great strategists opine that an engagement is decided before the first blow is landed, a combat against a graveknight often feels like a desperate fight in a rapidly closing vise. Infamous Graveknights Several of Golarion's most notorious villains are graveknights. The following examples are among the world's most infamous graveknights at large, and may inspire or serve as villains in your own games. Lictor Shokneir: Once the Hellknight leader of the notorious Order of the Crux, Lictor Shokneir was disgraced when he refused a royal order to disband his army of butchers. The other Hellknights surrounded him and razed his castle, Citadel Gheisteno, to the ground. However, Shokneir's determination sustains his now-undead form, and he and his undead legions have rebuilt the citadel in all its haunting glory. The Black Prince: Although the graveknight known simply as the Black Prince was redeemed centuries ago as part of Iomedae's 11 Acts, it is said that the prince's armor remains intact—and that vile forces conspire to reclaim it. If the armor is donned by one of the Black Prince's descendants, the Inner Sea will be beset by a terrible villain indeed. Other Powers You can use the alternate abilities as examples to create new powers reflecting a graveknight's personality or history, or even swap out more than one power. Graveknights should be unique and memorable foes. Steed Adaptations For some graveknights, their mount is more than a projection of their desire to move quickly around a battlefield. A graveknight's phantom steed might have the appearance, resistances, or movement of a favored mount the knight rode as a mortal, such as a nightmare's resistance to fire or a pegasus's Fly Speed. Unique Destruction While most graveknight armors can be destroyed with the standard means of destruction, particularly powerful graveknights might have more durable armor that requires additional steps to destroy. These are usually the armors of high-level graveknights, and their destruction steps are tied to the creation of the graveknight. For example, a specific graveknight armor can't be destroyed until it's struck by a descendant of the person that originally felled the graveknight in battle before their transformation.

Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. Increase its attack rolls, AC, saving throws, Perception, and skills by 1, its HP by 5, and its Strike damage by 1. Graveknight Abilities A graveknight gains the undead and graveknight traits, and its alignment is usually adjusted to evil. It loses any abilities that come from it being a living creature and any traits that represent its life, such as human and humanoid. Darkvision Negative Healing Rejuvenation (divine, necromancy) When a graveknight is destroyed, its armor rebuilds its body over the course of 1d10 days—or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host (see Graveknight Armor, below). If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts. A graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor (such as with disintegrate), transporting it to the Positive Energy Plane, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano. Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious, plus one energy type (the same chosen for ruinous weapons below). Sacrilegious Aura (abjuration, aura, divine, evil) 30 feet. When a creature in the aura uses a positive spell or ability, the graveknight automatically attempts to counteract it, with the listed counteract modifier. Devastating Blast Two Actions (arcane, evocation) The graveknight unleashes a 30-foot cone of energy. Creatures in the area take 1d12 damage, plus an additional 1d12 damage for every two levels the graveknight has (basic Reflex save). The graveknight can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. This energy damage is of the same type as that of its ruinous weapons (see below); Devastating Blast gains the associated energy trait. Phantom Mount Three Actions (arcane, conjuration, summon) The graveknight summons a supernatural mount as per phantom steed , heightened to a level equal to half the graveknight's level. Unlike phantom steed , the steed's AC and saving throw bonuses are all 4 lower than the graveknight's, and the steed has one-third the graveknight's Hit Points (rounded down). If the steed is destroyed, the graveknight must wait 1 hour before using this ability again. Ruinous Weapons At the time of its creation, a graveknight chooses one of the following energy types that was relevant to its life or death: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Any weapon the graveknight wields gains the effects of the corrosive , frost , shock , or flaming weapon rune, respectively, in addition to a +1 striking weapon rune. If the graveknight is 14th level or higher, its weapons instead gain the effects of the greater versions of both of these runes. Weapon Master The graveknight has access to the critical specialization effects of any weapons it wields. Alternate Graveknight Abilities You can create a more unusual graveknight by substituting one of their abilities (except for darkvision, negative healing, rejuvenation, or immunities) with one of the following. ### Bestiary Betrayed Revivification The graveknight died after being deeply betrayed. Instead of being immune to a type of energy damage, it is immune to mental damage, its weapons deal 1d6 additional mental damage, and its Devastating Blast deals mental damage with a Will saving throw instead of Reflex. Create Grave Squire The graveknight can gift a piece of its armor to a willing ally, which becomes its grave squire. The graveknight can communicate telepathically with its squire at any distance, see through the squire's senses, and cast suggestion as a divine innate spell through the telepathic link at will; the squire treats its degree of success as one step worse. If the graveknight's main armor is destroyed, the squire's piece expands to cover the squire's body over 1d10 days, after which point it becomes the graveknight's new body. The graveknight can have only one squire at a time, and must recover the gifted piece of armor if it wishes to create a new squire. Dark Deliverance The graveknight has positive resistance equal to its level. ### Pathfinder #172: Secrets of the Temple City Channel Magic Two Actions The graveknight redirects magical energies through its armor, allowing it to deliver magic through an attack. The graveknight Casts a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into an attack instead. The graveknight then makes a melee Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack. The spell is coupled with the attack, using the attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for the graveknight's multiple attack penalty but doesn't apply the penalty until after it's completed Channeling Magic. The graveknight can't use Channel Magic again for 1d4 rounds. ### Book Of The Dead Clutching Armor Reaction (arcane, transmutation) Trigger A creature attempts to move away from the graveknight; Effect The graveknight's armor animates and attempts to Grab the triggering creature. It makes an Athletics check to Grapple using the graveknight's Athletics modifier – 2. The armor can continue to Grapple the creature normally. Since the armor is grappling the creature, the graveknight doesn't need a free hand to do so. Eager for Battle (fortune) When the graveknight rolls initiative, they roll twice and take the better result. They're quickened during their first round after rolling initiative and can use this extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike. Empty Save for Dust The graveknight's armor contains nothing more than swirling dust that puffs out from joints in their armor. A living creature that touches or is touched by the graveknight (including one hit by the graveknight's fist Strike) must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or become contaminated with the dust. While contaminated, the targeted creature is stupefied 1 and gains weakness to the graveknight's energy damage equal to half the graveknight's level. The contamination ends after 1 minute or when the creature is doused with water, whichever occurs first. Graveknight's Shield (arcane, necromancy) The graveknight's curse extends to their shield, or the graveknight's armor uses a portion of itself to produce a shield. The graveknight has a shield that uses the statistics of a sturdy shield of a level no higher than the graveknight's level – 1. The shield is quasi-independent of the graveknight and automatically protects the graveknight from harm. When the shield is raised, it automatically uses Shield Block to reduce the damage of the first attack against the graveknight each round without the graveknight needing to spend their reaction to do so. The shield automatically rejuvenates with the rest of the graveknight and must be destroyed in the same manner as the graveknight's armor. Portentous Glare (aura, divine, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental, visual) 30 feet. The graveknight's visage is one of overwhelming menace. When a creature ends its turn in the aura, it must attempt a Will saving throw. A creature that fails is doomed 1 (or doomed 1 and frightened 2 on a critical failure). The graveknight can activate or deactivate the aura by using an Interact action to open or close their helmet visor. Graveknight Armor Wearing graveknight armor is very risky, for the graveknight's essence rapidly parasitizes the new wearer, accelerating the graveknight's rejuvenation. This agonizing transformation inevitably kills the host, transforming their flesh into the graveknight's new body. Removing the curse allows a character to remove the armor, but if it ever wears the armor again, the curse returns. If the wearer dies from another cause while wearing the armor, or if the graveknight's rejuvenation completes before the wearer dies from the curse, the wearer immediately progresses to stage 3. Graveknight's Curse (arcane, curse, necromancy) This curse affects anyone who wears a graveknight's armor for at least 1 hour. Saving Throw Will save; Onset 1 hour; Stage 1 doomed 1 and cannot remove the armor (1 day); Stage 2 doomed 2, hampered 10, and cannot remove the armor (1 day); Stage 3 dies and transforms into the armor's graveknight.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=291","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"creature-family-292","_score":4.226689,"_source":{"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Contemplative of Ashok","creature_family_markdown":"Contemplative of Ashok","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-292","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Contemplative of Ashok](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=292)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Pathfinder #173: Doorway to the Red Star](/Sources.aspx?ID=103) pg. 80\n\nThe ancestors of the Contemplatives of Ashok were humanoids of vast intellect who unlocked occult powers.

They deliberately evolved their mental faculties at the expense of their physical forms, and their atrophied bodies dangle beneath giant brains. Members Contemplative (Creature 2), Contemplative Meditant (Creature 15), Contemplative Mentor (Creature 18) Ashok Ashok refers both to an ancient impact crater on Akiton and the state of enlightenment the contemplatives seek to achieve. The exact relation between the crater and this philosophy is unclear, but evidence suggests that the crater's location could possibly be the contemplatives' long-lost ancestral homeland. Disciples of Time Contemplative meditants and mentors alike are obsessed with the complexities of time, but not in a way that seeks to abuse the knowledge to change the past. Instead, these contemplatives believe that pure thought can be achieved by ascending beyond the physical dimensions into beings composed of time itself. The existence of physical entities from the Dimension of Time, such as hounds of Tindalos &lt;%END> and siktemporas, constitutes a vexing paradox to these philosophies.

On the Material Plane, they spend the hours of daylight hidden below ground, amid ruins, or submerged deep in the ocean's darkest chasms beyond the reach of the sun's rays, emerging when darkness shelters them overhead. Darvakkas have an aura of entropy that attracts undead thralls to serve as warriors and heralds. They rarely seek alliances with each other or other creatures, existing in solitude as the heads of individual armies of the dead. Members Nasurgeth (Creature 20), Sykever (Creature 15), Umbraex (Creature 21), Urveth (Creature 18), Vanyver (Creature 13) Creating Nothing Darvakkas are made from the quintessence, spiritual essence made manifest in physical form, of fiends cast into the void at reality's end. The death of their immortal soul causes the creature to be consumed, catalyzing a change that scrambles them into an entirely new being that retains nothing of their previous self. Other Darvakkas The darvakkas presented on these pages aren't the only ones of their kind. Others exist, most having forms like animals, from tromping hounds to skittering arachnids. All their kind are greatly powerful, and ones more powerful even than nasurgeths doubtless exist—darvakkas who may even be akin to horrific demigods. The Bound One A darvakka bound to the yoke is an incredible weapon. I have four. Only my necromantic colleges of Yled can contain them in magical stasis: a trio of sykevers alongside an ancient darvakka I simply call The Bound One. Ensnaring him secured, for my purposes, an unending pool of negative energy. We shall see if it becomes necessary to call on their services more directly and loosen their leashes. The End of Reality In the deepest reaches of darkness, where the Plane of Shadow and the Negative Energy Plane meet, is a single fixed point where reality comes to an end. This planar juncture, a chasm of solid entropy formed into crystals by the weight of the infinite compressing eternally in upon itself, is where darvakka form.

Sometimes, they're tested beyond what they can bear, faced with forces they're incapable of defeating. Such a druid, seeing everything they have protected fall to destruction, might try the unthinkable. They might perform the ritual known as Welcome the Blighted Soul.\n\n With desperate prayer and a gory blood sacrifice, the druid becomes a siabrae, taking the corruption of the land into themself and binding both together, so they might survive and fight monsters in nature's service. A small few are able to use their newfound power to save their lands, and so the ritual's legend grows. Much more often, the druid becomes a twisted guardian of something past saving, the land they protect a macabre parody of healthy nature.

Where most siabraes are solitary beings, the Stonewild Sect is an organized cult, still active in the Sarkoris Scar.

A skeletal druid or wild witch, with bones the texture of stone and antlers of rock rising from their rough skulls, they're people who have willingly paid the ultimate price to protect the natural world. It rarely goes well for them. Druids and wild witches protect Golarion's environment from a host of threats—demonic invasions and undead horrors, otherworldly corruptions, and mundane greed and cupidity. Sometimes, they're tested beyond what they can bear, faced with forces they're incapable of defeating. Such a druid, seeing everything they have protected fall to destruction, might try the unthinkable. They might perform the ritual known as Welcome the Blighted Soul. With desperate prayer and a gory blood sacrifice, the druid becomes a siabrae, taking the corruption of the land into themself and binding both together, so they might survive and fight monsters in nature's service. A small few are able to use their newfound power to save their lands, and so the ritual's legend grows. Much more often, the druid becomes a twisted guardian of something past saving, the land they protect a macabre parody of healthy nature. Most siabraes are proud and bitter, obsessed with duty and branding their living brethren as cowards and traitors. Members Siabrae (Creature 16) The Stonewild Sect Once members of the Green Faith, the druids of Sarkoris fought as long and hard as anyone else against the invasion of demons that spewed forth from the Worldwound. When all hope was lost, a faction embraced the ritual to Welcome the Blighted Soul, becoming undead that lurk in the Stonewilds. Over the years since Sarkoris's fall, these druids developed their own twisted version of the Green Faith, embracing undeath and horror as the ultimate truth of the world. Where most siabraes are solitary beings, the Stonewild Sect is an organized cult, still active in the Sarkoris Scar. For the moment, they resist Tar-Baphon as an interloper, despite their shared undeath, but they're certainly no friends to the living. Unnatural Allies Few creations of nature are able to stomach working with a siabrae—their inherent miasma of wrongness is just too powerful. Most siabraes use undead as minions, particularly undead animals. Occasionally they ally with a sentient undead or loathsome fey, but these tend to be alliances of convenience. Creating a Siabrae A siabrae can be made from any primal spellcaster as long as they have the ability to perform a ritual of undeath as the primary caster (which can usually be performed only by a spellcaster capable of casting 6th-level spells). To create a siabrae, follow these steps: Increase the spellcaster's level by 1 and change their statistics as follows. Increase spell DCs and spell attack rolls by 2. Siabrae Abilities A siabrae gains the earth and undead traits and becomes evil. Siabraes lose all abilities that specifically come from being a living creature of their original kind. A siabrae gains the following abilities. Darkvision Tremorsense (imprecise) 60 feet Negative Healing Rejuvenation (primal, necromancy) When a siabrae is destroyed, they can attempt a DC 10 flat check (they automatically succeed if they're standing on blighted or diseased terrain, and automatically fail if they're standing on sacred ground).

Slender and pale, with sunken cheeks and exceptionally long nails, vetalaranas become flushed with color and life after feeding on particularly potent emotions and thoughts, enabling some to pass as living for a short time.\n\n A vetalarana is created when a person with psychic or occult abilities dies in denial of their death, refusing to pass on to the afterlife but unable to retain their grip on life. As their spirit has no cause left undone nor debt to settle, these tenacious souls rise not as ghosts but as vetalaranas, a formidable and tenacious mind animating their own corpse in a mockery of life.\n\n A vetalarana's predations inevitably turn their victims into living husks, incapable of thought and devoid of any spark of personality. These victims fall into a senseless stupor, comatose but still living, without identity or memories. If a vetalarana is killed, they can occupy one of these comatose husks, while more powerful vetalaranas can control them like living puppets.\n\n When a vetalarana is destroyed, all of their comatose victims are immediately freed. Most often, these people regain consciousness as amnesiacs whose memories return over time—taking at least months but sometimes as long as decades. These returned memories are fragmented and often jumbled with the thoughts of others the vetalarana fed upon. If a victim served as a failed host or was frequently controlled while comatose, a sliver of the vetalarana's corrupted thoughts remain in the victim's mind.

If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=90) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91). You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vetalarana's theme. \n\n **Thoughtsense** ([divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) The vetalarana senses all non-[mindless](/Traits.aspx?ID=108) creatures within 100 feet as a precise sense.\n\n **Negative Healing**\n\n **Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), paralyzed, [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145)\n\n **Vetalarana Vulnerabilities** All vetalaranas possess the following weaknesses. \n<ul><li>**Barred Senses** A vetalarana can't see or sense through [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=75) effects or [cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375), and their mind can't penetrate force effects or cold iron. Such barriers can prevent the transference of a vetalarana's mind through Mental Rebirth.</li><li>**Revulsion** A vetalarana delights in consuming memories and secrets, and is disgusted by those who share such sensitive tidbits openly. A vetalarana can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a creature loudly voicing their intimate personal secrets or most cherished memories aloud. Speaking such information aloud with conviction is a single action that has the [auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16), [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), and [linguistic](/Traits.aspx?ID=101) traits, and protects the creature until the start of its next turn. A vetalarana that involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a creature sharing such information gains the fleeing condition until they're 10 feet or farther from the creature. After 1 round of being exposed to the secrets of a creature, a vetalarana can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li><li>**Vulnerable to Brain Destruction** A vetalarana whose brain has been destroyed, or is reduced to 0 HP while unable to take [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) actions, can't use Mental Rebirth.</li></ul> **Mental Rebirth** ([curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) Unlike most other undead, a vetalarana isn't destroyed when they reach 0 HP. Instead, their body is destroyed, crumbling to ash, and their mind is immediately transferred into a creature they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. This creature must be within 1 mile; if no such creature is in range, the vetalarana is destroyed. The creature becomes [controlled](/Conditions.aspx?ID=6) by the vetalarana and loses the [stupefied](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) and [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38) conditions. If the creature controlled by a vetalarana in this way is killed, the vetalarana's mind transfers to another creature within 1 mile who they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts.<br /> After 1d6 days of being controlled, the controlled creature dies, and its body transforms into that of the vetalarana who rendered it comatose.\n\n **Climb Speed** A vetalarana gains a climb Speed equal to their land Speed.\n\n**Claws** If the base creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow to terrible proportions, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage, has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) trait, and can [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18). Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the [Strike Damage](/Rules.aspx?ID=1018) table.\n\n **Drain Thoughts** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) **Requirements** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), or willing creature is within the vetalarana's reach; **Effect** The vetalarana seizes a creature and consumes its memories. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is stupefied 1, and the vetalarana regains HP equal to 10% of the vetalarana's maximum HP, gaining any excess as temporary Hit Points. Draining Thoughts from a creature that is already stupefied doesn't restore any HP to the vetalarana but increases the victim's stupefied value by 1. Additionally, the vetalarana views one of the victim's memories.<br /> A victim's stupefied condition value decreases by 1 every week.<br /> A victim that becomes stupefied 5 in this way is rendered comatose, becoming permanently unconscious. As long as the vetalarana lives, a comatose victim can't regain consciousness, and its stupefied condition doesn't decrease. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Vetalarana Manipulator Abilities</title> Extremely powerful vetalaranas who've tasted the thoughts of hundreds of people or more become empowered by the memories and experiences they've consumed, overcoming their revulsions. They gain greater control over their comatose victims, can manipulate memories, and even paralyze with a touch. These vetalaranas are known as “manipulators,” although those with psychic powers of their own often prefer the terms “doyen” or “thoughtseer.” \n\nVetalarana manipulators gain additional abilities, as detailed below. A creature below 10th level isn't powerful enough to become a vetalarana manipulator; instead, make such a creature into a regular vetalarana or rebuild the creature so that it's at least 10th level before making it a vetalarana manipulator.\n\n **Resistances** The vetalarana manipulator resists [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) damage and all physical damage (except [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103) [cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375)).\n\n **Control Comatose** ([exploration](/Traits.aspx?ID=66), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [possession](/Traits.aspx?ID=129)) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The vetalarana manipulator spends 10 minutes to take psychic control of the creatures they've rendered comatose with Drain Thoughts. This has the effects of the [_possession_](/Spells.aspx?ID=225) spell, but lasts for up to 6 hours, has a range of 1 mile, and the vetalarana can control a number of comatose victims at a time equal to half the vetalarana's level. A comatose victim can't resist this possession and automatically gets a critical failure on its saving throw against Control Comatose.<br /> As long as a comatose victim is controlled by a vetalarana manipulator in this way, the victim's stupefied and unconscious conditions are temporarily suppressed.\n\n **Drain Thoughts** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) As a basic vetalarana, but the vetalarana manipulator can choose to alter, enhance, or erase the memory they view as a 4th-level [_modify memory_](/Spells.aspx?ID=200) spell. If the vetalarana gets a critical success on their Athletics check to Drain Thoughts, the target is stupefied 2 instead of stupefied 1.\n\n **Occult Innate Spells** A vetalarana manipulator has [_tongues_](/Spells.aspx?ID=340) as a constant occult innate spell.\n\n **Paralyzing Claws** ([incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) Any living creature hit by a vetalarana manipulator's claw Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save or become [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28). The target can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save. Use the moderate DC for the creature's level on the [Spell DC and Spell Attack Bonus](/Rules.aspx?ID=1020) table.","name":"Vampire, Vetalarana","primary_source":"Book of the Dead","primary_source_raw":"Book of the Dead pg. 160","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2022-04-27","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Book of the Dead](/Sources.aspx?ID=118) pg. 160\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nVetalarana vampires feed on the emotions, thoughts, and memories of others.

Thought Connoisseurs While all vetalaranas hunger for the most cherished memories and deepest secrets, vetalarana manipulators use the memories they consume to learn the skills and talents of their prey. Thus, they select their prey with great care. Each has their preferences, depending upon the skills they wish to cultivate, perhaps martial prowess, musical talent, arcane might, or enlightenment. Uses for Cold Iron Canny mortals looking to thwart a vetalarana make heavy use of cold iron. They line their sanctuaries with the material or surround comatose victims in cold iron sheets, armor, or shields. Others weave shrouds of cold iron thread or mix cold iron dust into paints and oils—though the efficacy of the latter is debatable. Vampire Related Families Vampire, Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Vampire, Nosferatu, Vampire, Strigoi, Vampire, Vrykolakas Creating a Vetalarana While it's best to create a vetalarana from scratch, you can turn an existing living creature into a vetalarana using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually becomes evil. Increase the creature's AC, attack modifiers, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Reduce its HP by the amount listed on the table. The vetalarana gains fast healing, resistance to mental damage, and resistance to physical damage (except cold iron) as indicated on the table. These abilities are the reason the vetalarana has less HP. ## Vetalarana Statistics Starting Level Starting Level Starting Level 3-4 –20 5 5-7 –30 7 8-14 –40 10 15+ –60 15 Basic Vetalarana Abilities All vetalaranas gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vetalarana's theme. Thoughtsense (divination, mental, occult) The vetalarana senses all non-mindless creatures within 100 feet as a precise sense. Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep Vetalarana Vulnerabilities All vetalaranas possess the following weaknesses. Barred Senses A vetalarana can't see or sense through force effects or cold iron, and their mind can't penetrate force effects or cold iron. Such barriers can prevent the transference of a vetalarana's mind through Mental Rebirth. Revulsion A vetalarana delights in consuming memories and secrets, and is disgusted by those who share such sensitive tidbits openly. A vetalarana can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a creature loudly voicing their intimate personal secrets or most cherished memories aloud. Speaking such information aloud with conviction is a single action that has the auditory, concentrate, and linguistic traits, and protects the creature until the start of its next turn. A vetalarana that involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a creature sharing such information gains the fleeing condition until they're 10 feet or farther from the creature. After 1 round of being exposed to the secrets of a creature, a vetalarana can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). Vulnerable to Brain Destruction A vetalarana whose brain has been destroyed, or is reduced to 0 HP while unable to take mental actions, can't use Mental Rebirth. Mental Rebirth (curse, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, occult) Unlike most other undead, a vetalarana isn't destroyed when they reach 0 HP. Instead, their body is destroyed, crumbling to ash, and their mind is immediately transferred into a creature they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. This creature must be within 1 mile; if no such creature is in range, the vetalarana is destroyed. The creature becomes controlled by the vetalarana and loses the stupefied and unconscious conditions. If the creature controlled by a vetalarana in this way is killed, the vetalarana's mind transfers to another creature within 1 mile who they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. After 1d6 days of being controlled, the controlled creature dies, and its body transforms into that of the vetalarana who rendered it comatose. Climb Speed A vetalarana gains a climb Speed equal to their land Speed. Claws If the base creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow to terrible proportions, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage, has the agile trait, and can Grab. Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table. Drain Thoughts Single Action (divination, mental, occult) Requirements A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vetalarana's reach; Effect The vetalarana seizes a creature and consumes its memories. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is stupefied 1, and the vetalarana regains HP equal to 10% of the vetalarana's maximum HP, gaining any excess as temporary Hit Points. Draining Thoughts from a creature that is already stupefied doesn't restore any HP to the vetalarana but increases the victim's stupefied value by 1. Additionally, the vetalarana views one of the victim's memories. A victim's stupefied condition value decreases by 1 every week. A victim that becomes stupefied 5 in this way is rendered comatose, becoming permanently unconscious. As long as the vetalarana lives, a comatose victim can't regain consciousness, and its stupefied condition doesn't decrease. Vetalarana Manipulator Abilities Extremely powerful vetalaranas who've tasted the thoughts of hundreds of people or more become empowered by the memories and experiences they've consumed, overcoming their revulsions. They gain greater control over their comatose victims, can manipulate memories, and even paralyze with a touch. These vetalaranas are known as “manipulators,” although those with psychic powers of their own often prefer the terms “doyen” or “thoughtseer.” Vetalarana manipulators gain additional abilities, as detailed below. A creature below 10th level isn't powerful enough to become a vetalarana manipulator; instead, make such a creature into a regular vetalarana or rebuild the creature so that it's at least 10th level before making it a vetalarana manipulator. Resistances The vetalarana manipulator resists mental damage and all physical damage (except magical cold iron). Control Comatose (exploration, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, occult, possession) Frequency once per day; Effect The vetalarana manipulator spends 10 minutes to take psychic control of the creatures they've rendered comatose with Drain Thoughts. This has the effects of the possession spell, but lasts for up to 6 hours, has a range of 1 mile, and the vetalarana can control a number of comatose victims at a time equal to half the vetalarana's level. A comatose victim can't resist this possession and automatically gets a critical failure on its saving throw against Control Comatose. As long as a comatose victim is controlled by a vetalarana manipulator in this way, the victim's stupefied and unconscious conditions are temporarily suppressed. Drain Thoughts Single Action (divination, mental, occult) As a basic vetalarana, but the vetalarana manipulator can choose to alter, enhance, or erase the memory they view as a 4th-level modify memory spell. If the vetalarana gets a critical success on their Athletics check to Drain Thoughts, the target is stupefied 2 instead of stupefied 1. Occult Innate Spells A vetalarana manipulator has tongues as a constant occult innate spell. Paralyzing Claws (incapacitation, occult, necromancy) Any living creature hit by a vetalarana manipulator's claw Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save or become paralyzed. The target can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save. Use the moderate DC for the creature's level on the Spell DC and Spell Attack Bonus table.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=311","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"creature-family-312","_score":4.226689,"_source":{"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Verdorite","creature_family_markdown":"Verdorite","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-312","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Verdorite](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=312)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Book of the Dead](/Sources.aspx?ID=118) pg. 164\n\nWhen disaster befalls the natural world, a different kind of undead may rise, entirely unlike risen humanoids.

They predate ancient [nosferatus](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=273) and view [moroi](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=97) as infantile children, yet their own origins are so far lost to the ravages of time that few today have heard of them and fewer still know their true nature. Many of the oldest tales about vampires trace back to the strigoi, and nearly every other vampire carries traits that ultimately have their roots in these powerful, ancient creatures.\n\n Strigoi, in their true form, are bodiless creatures native to the [Shadow Plane](/Planes.aspx?ID=11) that are incapable of interacting with the physical world, existing only as pure forces of malevolence. When this malevolence is invited into a physical body by method of ancient rituals, though, a strigoi becomes much more dangerous. This requirement—that a living creature perform a rite of their own free will to draw the strigoi into their soul—may well be the source of a moroi's compulsion not to enter a home without first being invited.\n\n Some myths point to [Urgathoa](/Deities.aspx?ID=19) as the source of the ritual that allowed spellcasters to become strigoi, while others suggest the method was spread by the cult of [Zura](/Deities.aspx?ID=83). Whatever the source, this long-lost ritual was no gateway to power, but instead a trap that allowed the strigoi to inhabit the shadows and souls of once-living hosts. In so doing, they found a way to exist in the world of flesh and blood. The presence of a strigoi within the shadow of a living host causes sickness and swift death, after which the strigoi bonds with the host's soul and becomes one with the body. Thus did the first of their kind invade the world of the living, and thus did the first vampires walk the night.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Strigoi Progenitor](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1944) (Creature 13)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">In Shadows</title>\r\n\r\nIn their true form as a shadow without a body, a strigoi is capable of thought and emotion and can communicate with the shadowy forms of other strigoi, but lacks any way to interact with the physical world. Countless strigoi exist in this manner on the Shadow Plane, patiently waiting for the ritual that allows mortals to invite them into reality to be discovered again.\r\n\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Strange Wounds</title>\r\n\r\nIconic puncture marks on the neck of a victim drained of blood are well known to vampire hunters, but the wounds left by strigoi are stranger. When a strigoi feeds on a living victim, the site of the wound becomes bleached of color, wrinkled, and strangely cold to the touch. These conditions fade if the wound heals; if a strigoi feeds enough to cause death by the drained condition, a creature leaves behind a withered gray husk of a bloodless body. Full autopsies on those slain in this manner reveal yet another unsettling curiosity: the brains of such victims are smooth, gray ovoids, the folds and fissures of gray matter fused together into a featureless mass.\r\n\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Strigoi and the Sun</title>\r\n\r\nAs long as they're not in shadow form, strigoi are more inconvenienced by sunlight than they are harmed by it, but being rendered [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38) certainly puts them at a disadvantage. As long as they're in an area where there's little risk of direct sunlight, such as being inside a room without exterior windows or doors, or in an underground area, some strigoi remain active during the day, only retreating to their coffins in emergencies. In so doing, these strigoi have further blended into society—there may be more of them than suspected!\r\n\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Strigoi Servants</title>\r\n\r\nWhen a strigoi creates a spawn from a creature that's not powerful enough to play host to a strigoi progenitor, the resulting strigoi is often referred to simply as a [strigoi servant](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1955). Statistics for a typical strigoi servant appear on page 25 of this adventure. Strigoi servants who escape servitude work hard to establish their own power, but rarely escape the mindset of existing only to serve their creator.\r\n\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature Family Group\">Vampire</title>\r\n\r\n**Related Families**\r\n[Vampire](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=97), [Vampire, Jiang-Shi](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=286), [Vampire, Nosferatu](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=273), [Vampire, Vetalarana](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=311), [Vampire, Vrykolakas](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=159)\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Creating a Strigoi</title>\r\n\r\nA creature of 8th to 12th level can become a [strigoi servant](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1955) (see page 25 of this adventure for the typical statistics for a strigoi servant); only 13th-level or higher creatures can become strigoi progenitors. A creature below 8th level infected by a strigoi becomes a free-willed [moroi vampire](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=97) instead (indeed, it is from this method the first moroi eventually came into the world).

If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=90) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91). You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the strigoi's theme.\n\n[**Greater Darkvision**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\n\n[**Negative Healing**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)\n\n**Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), paralyze, [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145) **Coffin Restoration** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118)) As with moroi vampires, a strigoi isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38) and loses fast healing. If its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the strigoi gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally.\n\n**Strigoi Weaknesses** All strigoi possess the following weaknesses:\n<ul><li>**Revulsion** Strigoi are uncomfortable near mirrors or sources of bright light. Only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to [Raising a Shield](/Actions.aspx?ID=98)). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to [Sense Motive](/Actions.aspx?ID=85).</li><li>**Sunlight** When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes unconscious and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful Perception check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its “dead” body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like [_detect evil_](/Spells.aspx?ID=65), senses like [lifesense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=21), and the “corpse” taking damage from [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128) energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the “corpse” in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed.</li><li>**Water Revulsion** A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes [slowed 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35) and gains the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) condition as long as it remains in the water. At the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or be destroyed.</li></ul>**Levitation** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [shadow](/Traits.aspx?ID=143)) Strigoi can cast [_levitate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=170) at will as a divine innate spell; when they do so, they appear to ascend or descend on a coiling mass of shadows.\n\n**Claws** If the creature had hands, its shadow solidifies around the fingers when it attacks, granting it a claw Strike that deals slashing damage, and has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) and [magic](/Traits.aspx?ID=103) traits. The damage caused by its claws should be roughly the same as the [moderate Strike damage for a creature of its level](/Rules.aspx?ID=1018).\n\n**Drink Essence** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Requirements** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), or willing creature is within the strigoi's reach; **Effect** The strigoi sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood and draw out its vital essence. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the creature's Fortitude DC if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The creature becomes [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) and [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37), and the strigoi regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of).<br /> A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.<br /> A victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. If the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely.\n\n**Grab** The creature's claw attacks gain [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18).

In shadow form, the strigoi gains a climb Speed equal to its land Speed and can move through any gap that isn't airtight. However, it can only move along solid surfaces that aren't highly reflective, not liquid or mirrored surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed, the strigoi returns to physical form and is [stunned 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=36). The strigoi loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely.<br /> A strigoi that is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form becomes slowed 2 and must attempt a DC 16 flat check at the end of each of its turns. If it fails this flat check, it is destroyed, the shadow vanishing with a blood-curdling wail. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Strigoi Progenitor Abilities</title> Powerful strigoi that form from the fusion of a strigoi from the Shadow Plane and a living host gain additional abilities as detailed below.

If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. A victim that is 8th level or higher becomes a strigoi servant, while a lower-level victim instead becomes a moroi vampire. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.\n\n**Shadow Escape** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> **Trigger** The strigoi is reduced to 0 HP; **Effect** The strigoi uses Shadow Form. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the strigoi is unaffected by further damage. Once the strigoi reaches its coffin, or if it hasn't done so within 2 hours, it automatically returns to its physical form, unconscious.\n\n**Domain of Dusk** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [shadow](/Traits.aspx?ID=143)) With a wave of its hand, the strigoi calls fourth vile ruination from the surrounding shadows, causing coils of darkness and shadowy bats, rats, and wolves to lash out at living targets in a 30-foot emanation.

They predate ancient nosferatus and view moroi as infantile children, yet their own origins are so far lost to the ravages of time that few today have heard of them and fewer still know their true nature. Many of the oldest tales about vampires trace back to the strigoi, and nearly every other vampire carries traits that ultimately have their roots in these powerful, ancient creatures. Strigoi, in their true form, are bodiless creatures native to the Shadow Plane that are incapable of interacting with the physical world, existing only as pure forces of malevolence. When this malevolence is invited into a physical body by method of ancient rituals, though, a strigoi becomes much more dangerous. This requirement—that a living creature perform a rite of their own free will to draw the strigoi into their soul—may well be the source of a moroi's compulsion not to enter a home without first being invited. Some myths point to Urgathoa as the source of the ritual that allowed spellcasters to become strigoi, while others suggest the method was spread by the cult of Zura. Whatever the source, this long-lost ritual was no gateway to power, but instead a trap that allowed the strigoi to inhabit the shadows and souls of once-living hosts. In so doing, they found a way to exist in the world of flesh and blood. The presence of a strigoi within the shadow of a living host causes sickness and swift death, after which the strigoi bonds with the host's soul and becomes one with the body. Thus did the first of their kind invade the world of the living, and thus did the first vampires walk the night. Members Strigoi Progenitor (Creature 13) In Shadows In their true form as a shadow without a body, a strigoi is capable of thought and emotion and can communicate with the shadowy forms of other strigoi, but lacks any way to interact with the physical world. Countless strigoi exist in this manner on the Shadow Plane, patiently waiting for the ritual that allows mortals to invite them into reality to be discovered again. Strange Wounds Iconic puncture marks on the neck of a victim drained of blood are well known to vampire hunters, but the wounds left by strigoi are stranger. When a strigoi feeds on a living victim, the site of the wound becomes bleached of color, wrinkled, and strangely cold to the touch. These conditions fade if the wound heals; if a strigoi feeds enough to cause death by the drained condition, a creature leaves behind a withered gray husk of a bloodless body. Full autopsies on those slain in this manner reveal yet another unsettling curiosity: the brains of such victims are smooth, gray ovoids, the folds and fissures of gray matter fused together into a featureless mass. Strigoi and the Sun As long as they're not in shadow form, strigoi are more inconvenienced by sunlight than they are harmed by it, but being rendered unconscious certainly puts them at a disadvantage. As long as they're in an area where there's little risk of direct sunlight, such as being inside a room without exterior windows or doors, or in an underground area, some strigoi remain active during the day, only retreating to their coffins in emergencies. In so doing, these strigoi have further blended into society—there may be more of them than suspected! Strigoi Servants When a strigoi creates a spawn from a creature that's not powerful enough to play host to a strigoi progenitor, the resulting strigoi is often referred to simply as a strigoi servant. Statistics for a typical strigoi servant appear on page 25 of this adventure. Strigoi servants who escape servitude work hard to establish their own power, but rarely escape the mindset of existing only to serve their creator. Vampire Related Families Vampire, Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Vampire, Nosferatu, Vampire, Vetalarana, Vampire, Vrykolakas Creating a Strigoi A creature of 8th to 12th level can become a strigoi servant (see page 25 of this adventure for the typical statistics for a strigoi servant); only 13th-level or higher creatures can become strigoi progenitors. A creature below 8th level infected by a strigoi becomes a free-willed moroi vampire instead (indeed, it is from this method the first moroi eventually came into the world). You can turn an existing living creature into a strigoi using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows: It gains the shadow, undead, and vampire traits, and almost always becomes evil. Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times, increase the damage by 2 instead. The strigoi gains fast healing and resistance to all physical damage except from silver weapons or weapons that shed at least 5 feet of bright light (such as a lit torch or a weapon targeted by the light spell, but not a flaming weapon) based on the table below. These abilities are the reason the strigoi has fewer HP. ## Strigoi Statistics Starting Level HP Decrease Fast Healing/Resistance 8-14 -40 10 15+ -60 15 Basic Strigoi Abilities All strigoi gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the strigoi's theme. Greater Darkvision Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyze, poison, sleep Coffin Restoration (divine, necromancy, negative) As with moroi vampires, a strigoi isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls unconscious and loses fast healing. If its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the strigoi gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally. Strigoi Weaknesses All strigoi possess the following weaknesses: Revulsion Strigoi are uncomfortable near mirrors or sources of bright light. Only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the fleeing condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to Sense Motive. Sunlight When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes unconscious and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful Perception check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its “dead” body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like detect evil , senses like lifesense, and the “corpse” taking damage from positive energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the “corpse” in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed. Water Revulsion A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes slowed 2 and gains the fleeing condition as long as it remains in the water. At the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or be destroyed. Levitation Two Actions (divine, evocation, shadow) Strigoi can cast levitate at will as a divine innate spell; when they do so, they appear to ascend or descend on a coiling mass of shadows. Claws If the creature had hands, its shadow solidifies around the fingers when it attacks, granting it a claw Strike that deals slashing damage, and has the agile and magic traits. The damage caused by its claws should be roughly the same as the moderate Strike damage for a creature of its level. Drink Essence Single Action (divine, necromancy) Requirements A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the strigoi's reach; Effect The strigoi sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood and draw out its vital essence. This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The creature becomes drained 1 and stupefied 1, and the strigoi regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of). A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. A victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. If the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely. Grab The creature's claw attacks gain Grab. When it uses this ability, its shadowy claws seem almost to latch on to any shadows cast by the grabbed creature. Shadow Form Single Action (concentrate, divine, shadow, transmutation) The strigoi reverts to pure shadow and absorbs its body and its gear into the darkness, or it shifts back to its physical form. In shadow form, the strigoi gains a climb Speed equal to its land Speed and can move through any gap that isn't airtight. However, it can only move along solid surfaces that aren't highly reflective, not liquid or mirrored surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed, the strigoi returns to physical form and is stunned 1. The strigoi loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely. A strigoi that is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form becomes slowed 2 and must attempt a DC 16 flat check at the end of each of its turns. If it fails this flat check, it is destroyed, the shadow vanishing with a blood-curdling wail. Strigoi Progenitor Abilities Powerful strigoi that form from the fusion of a strigoi from the Shadow Plane and a living host gain additional abilities as detailed below. A creature below level 13 is not a significant enough host to become a strigoi progenitor. Resistances The strigoi progenitor resists all physical damage except magical silver weapons or magical weapons that shed at least 5 feet of bright light. Fly Speed Instead of being able to levitate at will, a strigoi progenitor gains a fly Speed equal to their land Speed. When a strigoi progenitor flies, it manifests batlike wings made of shadow. Create Spawn (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Domain of Dusk or Drink Essence, the strigoi can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. A victim that is 8th level or higher becomes a strigoi servant, while a lower-level victim instead becomes a moroi vampire. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC. Shadow Escape Free Action Trigger The strigoi is reduced to 0 HP; Effect The strigoi uses Shadow Form. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the strigoi is unaffected by further damage. Once the strigoi reaches its coffin, or if it hasn't done so within 2 hours, it automatically returns to its physical form, unconscious. Domain of Dusk Two Actions (conjuration, divine, shadow) With a wave of its hand, the strigoi calls fourth vile ruination from the surrounding shadows, causing coils of darkness and shadowy bats, rats, and wolves to lash out at living targets in a 30-foot emanation. Living creatures in this area take 1d6 negative damage +1d6 per 2 levels possessed by the strigoi (basic Fortitude save against the DC of the strigoi's level). A creature that fails this save is also dazzled for 1 round (or blinded for 1 round and then dazzled for 1 round) by the darkness. The strigoi progenitor can't use Domain of Dusk for 1 minute. Dominate Two Actions (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses the DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.

Choose whether the mutant creates a 60-foot line of energy or a 30-foot cone of energy when they activate this ability. The energy deals 1d6 damage per level with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save.

Choose whether the mutant creates a 60- foot line of energy or a 30-foot cone of energy when it activates this ability. The energy deals 1d6 damage per level with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save. The mutant can't use Energy Blast again for 1d4 rounds. \n\n**Inoculation** The mutant's flesh is distorted with the addition of unexpected fur, scales, warts, or other growths. The creature gains a +2 status bonus to saves against [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46) and [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126). In rare cases, you might choose to grant immunity instead. \n\n**Increased Speed** The mutant's limbs change, or it grows new limbs to accommodate its mutation.

The physiological effects of this exposure vary in scope from grotesque full-body transformations to more subtle changes to the skin or senses, and they're frequently accompanied by changes in disposition, motivation, or temperament. Members Mutant Desert Drake (Creature 9), Mutant Giant Toad (Creature 3), Mutant Gnoll Hulk (Creature 9) Aberrant, not Ableist! The trope of the mutant is a common one in speculative fiction but often draws deeply on concepts that fear and mock anyone with an appearance that falls outside of a perceived norm. When creating a mutant, be careful to avoid any traits that might match real-world deformities or disabilities that people might have—a giant wolf mouth in the middle of a mutant's stomach is okay, but having a simple withered limb or a swollen face might be inappropriate for a mutant character. Creating Mutants In most cases, it's better to build a new Mana Wastes mutant from the ground up, using the standard rules for monster creation (this is how the mutants presented here were built). An existing creature can be turned into a Mana Wastes mutant by increasing its level (generally by 1 or 2), increasing its statistics accordingly, and giving it one or more of the Mana Wastes mutant abilities on this page. Mana Wastes Mutant Communities Rumors circulate in Alkenstar of mutant settlements deep in the Mana Wastes. In these settlements, mutants have reportedly banded together for survival in the harsh environment, though accounts differ on whether such communities welcome and shelter lost travelers or eliminate non-mutants who stumble upon them. Other Mutants The Mana Wastes are notorious for the production of mutants but the strange energies of the Spellscar Desert are far from the only things that can transform a creature into a mutant. You can use the rules for creating a Mana Wastes mutant to create any sort of mutated creature, such as might occur after exposure to otherworldly radiation in Numeria, succumbing to planar effects from a chaotic outer plane, imbibing a potent mutagen like the notorious milk of Lamashtu, or suffering potent side effects from a ritual gone catastrophically wrong Mana Wastes Mutant Abilities All Mana Wastes mutants gain darkvision (replacing low-light vision if the creature had it), and the DC to Recall Knowledge about a mutant increases by 2. The creature gains the mutant trait. They usually have one or two of the following abilities, or potentially three if the mutant is 9th level or higher. If you apply these abilities to an existing creature, either raise the level and adjust the statistics, or remove some of the creature's abilities to make room for the new abilities. Select two of the following abilities, or potentially three if the Mana Wastes mutant is 9th level or higher. These abilities should relate to the manner that the base creature used magic in life or to the nature of the wild magic that caused their mutation. You can also create new abilities or adapt others from monsters or classes to fit the theme. Lost Omens Impossible Lands Source Impossible Lands pg. 332 Caustic Pustules Whenever the mutant takes piercing or slashing damage, creatures adjacent to the mutant take 1d6 acid damage (basic Reflex save). The damage increases to 2d6 if the mutant is at least 8th level and 3d6 if the mutant is at least 15th level. Chameleon Skin The mutant can change their coloration to match their surroundings. They don't need cover or concealment to attempt to Hide with a Stealth check. Eldritch Attraction (enchantment, mental) A creature who casts a spell within 30 feet of the mutant must succeed at a Will save or spend its next action to Stride toward the mutant. It can't Delay or take any reactions until it has obeyed the compulsion. Energy Blast two-actions] ([evocation, primal) Choose an energy type; this ability gains that energy type as a trait. The mutant gains some sort of physical alteration to their shape that suggests how they trigger their energy blast, be it numerous pustules on their body, an extra limb, or an additional opening in their throat to exhale the blast as a breath weapon. Choose whether the mutant creates a 60-foot line of energy or a 30-foot cone of energy when they activate this ability. The energy deals 1d6 damage per level with a basic Reflex save. The mutant can't use Energy Blast again for 1d4 rounds. Energy Resistance The mutant has strangely colored skin or fur and gains resistance to a single type of energy damage. The amount of energy resistance gained depends on the mutant's level. ## Mutant Energy Resistance Mutant's Level Energy Resistance 2 or lower 2 3–7 5 8–14 10 15+ 15 Grasping Tentacle The mutant grows a writhing, serpentine appendage, granting them a tentacle Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals bludgeoning damage), and the Grab ability with that Strike. If they had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by their tentacle should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If they had only non-agile attacks, their tentacle should deal three-quarters that damage. Hulking Form Increase the mutant's size by one category. Decrease their AC by 1, increase their HP by 1/10 their normal maximum HP, and increase the reach of all their melee Strikes by 5 feet. Hungry Maw A mouth full of razor-sharp teeth opens somewhere on the mutant's body. They gain a maw Strike (an unarmed attack that does piercing damage roughly the same as the damage dealt by their most damaging melee attack), and they gain the Vengeful Bite reaction. Vengeful Bite Reaction Trigger A creature critically hits the mutant with a melee unarmed Strike or a non-reach melee Strike ; Effect The mutant makes a maw Strike against the triggering creature. Increased Speed The mutant's limbs change, or they grow new limbs to accommodate their mutation. Either one of their existing Speeds increases by 20 feet or they gain a new Speed (such as fly or swim) of 15 feet. Magic Hunger The mutant gains the ability to detect the source of any magic within 30 feet as an imprecise sense. Mirror Thing Single Action (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation) The mutant takes on the specific appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid they can currently see. This doesn't alter their statistics, but it might change the damage type of their Strikes. Revolting Appearance (arcane, aura, visual) Details of the mutant's appearance are disturbing and unnatural in the extreme. A non-mutant living creature who begins their turn within 60 feet of the mutant must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened 2. A creature who succeeds at its save is then temporarily immune to the aura for 24 hours. Sprouted Limb The mutant grows an extra leg, increasing their Speed by 10 feet. Too Many Eyes Countless eyes sprout on the mutant's skin. They gain all-around vision. Cradle Of Quartz Source Pathfinder #179: Cradle of Quartz pg. 84 Afflicting Strike The mutant must have a jaws, claw, sting, or other melee Strike to gain this ability. That Strike now inflicts a disease, poison, or similar affliction on a hit, with a Fortitude save to resist. You can use the rules for existing monsters of the mutant's level for diseases, poisons, and similar afflictions to give to your mutant, or you can simply say the strike inflicts an additional 1d6 poison damage + an additional 1d6 points per 4 mutant levels on a hit, with a basic Fortitude save. This makes the Strike significantly more deadly, so reduce the damage in other ways to account for this increase. Energy Resistance The mutant has strangely colored skin or fur and gains resistance to a single type of energy damage. The amount of energy resistance gained depends on the mutant's level: ## Mutant Energy Resistance Mutant's Level Energy Resistance 2 or lower 2 3-7 5 8-14 10 15+ 15 Energy Blast Two Actions (evocation, primal) Choose an energy type; this ability gains that energy type as a trait. The mutant gains some sort of physical alteration to its shape that suggests how it triggers its energy blast, be it numerous pustules on its body, an additional limb, or additional opening in its throat to exhale the blast as a breath weapon. Choose whether the mutant creates a 60- foot line of energy or a 30-foot cone of energy when it activates this ability. The energy deals 1d6 damage per level with a basic Reflex save. The mutant can't use Energy Blast again for 1d4 rounds. Inoculation The mutant's flesh is distorted with the addition of unexpected fur, scales, warts, or other growths. The creature gains a +2 status bonus to saves against disease and poison. In rare cases, you might choose to grant immunity instead. Increased Speed The mutant's limbs change, or it grows new limbs to accommodate its mutation. Either one of its existing Speeds increases by 20 feet, or it gains a new Speed (such as fly or swim) of 15 feet.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=315","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"creature-family-317","_score":4.226689,"_source":{"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Animated Bones","creature_family_markdown":"Animated Bones","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-317","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Animated Bones](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=317)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Pathfinder #181: Zombie Feast](/Sources.aspx?ID=139) pg. 82\n\nCommonly mistaken for [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160), animated bones are mindless constructs with no connection to [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117).

Cracked, frostbitten flesh that emits a freezing vapor like steam; inexorable, unhindered strides through feet of ash-blackened snow; a vacant, icy-blue gaze devoid of humanity—the descriptions of blackfrost dead vary by the teller, but none can deny the supernatural dread these monsters evoke.\n\n Blackfrost dead take a variety of forms. Most are mindless, lumbering brutes, largely indiscernible from mundane zombies except for the curse they can inflict. Others not only maintain their presence of mind but wield powers of psychic corruption not unlike those of blackfrost's originator, Osoyo, the Blackfrost Whale. What form a blackfrost dead takes depends primarily on the victim's psychic fortitude and its aptitude for occult magic.\n\n See the [curse](/Curses.aspx?ID=51) for further details on blackfrost. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Blackfrost Dead Abilities</title> You can modify an existing undead creature to become blackfrost dead using the following abilities. All blackfrost dead bear the [curse of blackfrost](/Curses.aspx?ID=51) and have some way to inflict it, usually using one of their existing Strikes. Most blackfrost dead have one other ability from this list as well. As blackfrost dead stem from blackfrost itself, all blackfrost dead have the [rare](/Traits.aspx?ID=137) trait.\n\n **Blackfrost Breath** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) The blackfrost dead gasps sharply, then exhales a mist of dark-blue blackfrost particles in a 5-foot emanation. All creatures within the mist become [concealed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=4), and all creatures outside the mist become concealed to creatures within it. The mist persists for 1 minute. A creature that ends its turn in the mist is exposed to blackfrost. The blackfrost dead can't use Blackfrost Breath again for 1d4 rounds.\n\n **Ice Climb** The blackfrost dead can climb on ice as though it had the listed climb Speed. It ignores difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain from ice and snow and doesn't risk falling when crossing ice.\n\n **Mindburning Gaze** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163)) The blackfrost dead fixes its terrifying gaze on a creature within 60 feet. The creature takes 1d4 mental damage per level of the blackfrost dead (minimum 2d4), with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Will save. On a critical failure, the creature is [frightened 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=19).\n\n **Shattering Death** ([cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=27)) When the blackfrost dead is destroyed, its body shatters like brittle ice, filling the air around it with a cloud of frigid, razor-sharp ice shards. Creatures in a 10-foot emanation take 1d8 cold damage per level of the blackfrost dead (minimum 3d8), with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Reflex save. Creatures that critically fail this save also take 1d6 [persistent bleed damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Blackfrost Guecubu](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2509) (Creature 8), [Blackfrost Prophet](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2498) (Creature 9), [Blackfrost Zombie](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2497) (Creature 6)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Creating Blackfrost Dead</title>\r\n\r\nThe simplest way to create a blackfrost dead is to use an existing undead, such as a [zombie](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=103) or a [mummy](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=74), as your base creature.

Cracked, frostbitten flesh that emits a freezing vapor like steam; inexorable, unhindered strides through feet of ash-blackened snow; a vacant, icy-blue gaze devoid of humanity—the descriptions of blackfrost dead vary by the teller, but none can deny the supernatural dread these monsters evoke. Blackfrost dead take a variety of forms. Most are mindless, lumbering brutes, largely indiscernible from mundane zombies except for the curse they can inflict. Others not only maintain their presence of mind but wield powers of psychic corruption not unlike those of blackfrost's originator, Osoyo, the Blackfrost Whale. What form a blackfrost dead takes depends primarily on the victim's psychic fortitude and its aptitude for occult magic. See the curse for further details on blackfrost. Blackfrost Dead Abilities You can modify an existing undead creature to become blackfrost dead using the following abilities. All blackfrost dead bear the curse of blackfrost and have some way to inflict it, usually using one of their existing Strikes. Most blackfrost dead have one other ability from this list as well. As blackfrost dead stem from blackfrost itself, all blackfrost dead have the rare trait. Blackfrost Breath Two Actions (conjuration, occult) The blackfrost dead gasps sharply, then exhales a mist of dark-blue blackfrost particles in a 5-foot emanation. All creatures within the mist become concealed, and all creatures outside the mist become concealed to creatures within it. The mist persists for 1 minute. A creature that ends its turn in the mist is exposed to blackfrost. The blackfrost dead can't use Blackfrost Breath again for 1d4 rounds. Ice Climb The blackfrost dead can climb on ice as though it had the listed climb Speed. It ignores difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain from ice and snow and doesn't risk falling when crossing ice. Mindburning Gaze Two Actions (emotion, fear, necromancy, occult, visual) The blackfrost dead fixes its terrifying gaze on a creature within 60 feet. The creature takes 1d4 mental damage per level of the blackfrost dead (minimum 2d4), with a basic Will save. On a critical failure, the creature is frightened 1. Shattering Death (cold) When the blackfrost dead is destroyed, its body shatters like brittle ice, filling the air around it with a cloud of frigid, razor-sharp ice shards. Creatures in a 10-foot emanation take 1d8 cold damage per level of the blackfrost dead (minimum 3d8), with a basic Reflex save. Creatures that critically fail this save also take 1d6 persistent bleed damage. Members Blackfrost Guecubu (Creature 8), Blackfrost Prophet (Creature 9), Blackfrost Zombie (Creature 6) Creating Blackfrost Dead The simplest way to create a blackfrost dead is to use an existing undead, such as a zombie or a mummy, as your base creature. Replace the creature's abilities with abilities from the list on this page. All blackfrost dead gain the cold trait and have at least one way to inflict blackfrost, often using one of their Strikes. Curse of the Crown Blackfrost dead are found only around the Nameless Spires, under which a massive alien being named Osoyo remains imprisoned. Only recently has this ancient being stirred from its slumber, causing blackfrost to foam out of fissures in the ice and afflict unfortunate explorers. The spread of the blackfrost curse has been mercifully slow thus far, but with each creature afflicted, Osoyo's reach expands ever outward.

Using valuable parasitic fungal spores, a ritualist may seed the corpse of a creature and encourage them to grow, sending mycelium tendrils throughout the body. The tendrils bond to mobile tissue such as bones, while replacing tendons with reinforced mycelium.

The woods can be a dangerous place. Though some resemble animals, the elemental beasts presented here are still plants, and their life cycles reflect it. Vegetable lambs grow on rooted stalks, from which they can't be removed until they've matured (or perhaps ripened), leaving them dependent on their immediate surroundings for food.

A force for entropy and the breaking of cycles, nindorus are hideous creatures whose bodies often appear distorted, who wield weapons that have been shattered yet still function, and whose true face is often hidden from view. They display traits one might expect to see in an undead creature, such as decaying flesh or exposed bones, yet a nindoru is very much still alive.\n\n Each nindoru epitomizes the fracture of a specific cycle, be it one from the natural world or from societal traditions. To the nindoru, nothing is more delicious than the consumption of a creature who has reincarnated multiple times, with those who are theoretically about to ascend to true enlightenment presenting the tastiest meal. Those slain by a nindoru are themselves torn from the cycle—the lucky ones move on to the Boneyard for judgment, but many are instead corrupted to form more of these horrific fiends.\n\n Followers of Sangpotshi find nindoru to be particularly abhorrent and count them among the greatest threats imaginable.

A force for entropy and the breaking of cycles, nindorus are hideous creatures whose bodies often appear distorted, who wield weapons that have been shattered yet still function, and whose true face is often hidden from view. They display traits one might expect to see in an undead creature, such as decaying flesh or exposed bones, yet a nindoru is very much still alive. Each nindoru epitomizes the fracture of a specific cycle, be it one from the natural world or from societal traditions. To the nindoru, nothing is more delicious than the consumption of a creature who has reincarnated multiple times, with those who are theoretically about to ascend to true enlightenment presenting the tastiest meal. Those slain by a nindoru are themselves torn from the cycle—the lucky ones move on to the Boneyard for judgment, but many are instead corrupted to form more of these horrific fiends. Followers of Sangpotshi find nindoru to be particularly abhorrent and count them among the greatest threats imaginable. Most commonly found in regions of the world where the reincarnation cycle is strongest, nindorus are, like rakshasas and oni, associated most strongly with the Material Plane. Members Akashti (Creature 10), Argyrzei (Creature 13), Guhdggi (Creature 5), Ijda (Creature 6), Kagekuma (Creature 8), Meokdan (Creature 2), Shisagishin (Creature 12), Sojiruh (Creature 4) Nindoru Butterflies One of the strangest shared traits of the various types of nindoru are the blood-red butterflies that seem to follow them around, nest on their bodies, or periodically emerge from their wounds. These unnerving insects are physical manifestations of the nindorus' thoughts and symbolize the countless past lives they once lived but turned their backs on. Nindoru butterflies never last long once they flutter more than a few feet from their source, fading away into smoke that quickly dissipates into the air. Nindoru Demigods The most powerful nindorus are demigods, although their cults are quite rare. Prone to reincarnation after death, nindoru demigods like Kugaptee are more properly known as “nindoru ascetics.” Nindoru Trait Nindorus are chaotic evil fiends that rise from corruptions to the cycle of reincarnating souls and live on the Material Plane. Although they often have elements in their appearance that make them seem undead, they're actually living beings. Most nindorus have darkvision, are immune to death effects, have weakness to silver, and possess the power to manifest objects or creatures from their thoughts. Nindoru Traitors While most nindorus are purely chaotic evil in nature, legends tell of exceptionally rare nindorus who manage to escape their own nature and ascend, reincarnating after death into kami or other more benevolent spirits and shedding the nindoru trait as they do so. Of course, these “traitors” are regarded as the most delicious meals imaginable by the nindorus left behind. Other Nindorus Many other types of nindorus exist beyond the four presented on these pages. Others include the corpse- copying akashtis (sobbing nindorus), infiltrators of society known as kagekumas (lurking nindorus), the dead defiling shisagishins (crooked nindorus), and the powerful and brutal argyrzeis (headless nindorus). Reincarnated Souls In some cases, you’ll know if a creature a nindoru attacks has a reincarnated soul. Ancestries like samsarans are always reincarnated souls, and a PC’s backstory or even their background can often indicate the presence of a previous life.

Alghollthus shaped …","text":" Alghollthu Source Monster Core pg. 12 1.1 In bygone millennia, aquatic monsters known as alghollthus used their occult powers to conquer and rule vast swaths of the world. Alghollthus shaped their servitors and other creatures using mental manipulation and physically transformative magic. The rulers of the alghollthus, the so-called “veiled masters,” further shaped entire societies by assuming the forms of those they controlled. In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with upstart surface societies and meddling gods. They used incredible magical power to call forth a cataclysm, hoping to destroy the rebellious societies they'd manipulated. Yet they miscalculated the will to survive of those they treated as their pawns, and in time the world recovered, this time free of alghollthu influence. Today, the alghollthus have mostly remained within the deep aquatic realms where they still rule without question. Yet they have not abandoned their plots entirely, and the reemergence of servitors like faceless stalkers suggests that the alghollthus have turned their hateful eyes to the surface once again. Members Ugothol (Creature 4), Vidileth (Creature 14) Ancient Influences The veiled masters influenced the ancient Azlanti, and it was they who invoked the apocalypse of Earthfall to destroy Azlant when humanity grew too prideful. That this act also called down the magical Starstone, an artifact capable of transforming mortals into gods, was an ironic turn of events considering the alghollthus' intolerance for faith. Other Alghollthus While the veiled masters are the rulers of alghollthu society, they are not the most powerful of their kind. Greater, more mysterious creatures that function as organic thought networks, immense aquatic engines of war, or specialized extractors of forgotten secrets dwell among their sunken cities. Meanwhile, the world above remains infested with creatures that were originally created by the alghollthus but have long since drifted away from their aquatic progenitors to become their own sinister monstrosities.

Before gods and their servants set foot in the celestial planes, archons already resided in Heaven, the original inhabitants of the realm. Upon meeting, the archons and divine [angels](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=3) quickly discovered they were of a kind, holding justice and righteousness in their hearts. An alliance was formed, and archons now serve as stalwart allies to all celestials and mortals they find worthy.\n\n While the first archons coalesced from the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven, they choose willing and worthy Heaven-bound souls to join their ranks. These mortals hear and answer the call of a mysterious voice, manifesting in the Garden at the mountain's peak. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their new archon forms.\n\n Though deeply concerned with defending mortal life and willing to sacrifice themselves in battle against fiends, archons often feel rote and inscrutable to others, and their forms can border on frightening and bizarre. For this reason, they often have issues with interacting with mortals, or with the free spirited [azatas](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=10). Despite this, archons draw great strength from others, especially those who exemplify virtue.\n\n Beyond their celestial allies, archons also maintain ancient ties with [aeons](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=2). The inscrutable factions can still be seen working together to defend long- forgotten secrets and enforce rules that predate mortal life.

Before gods and their servants set foot in the celestial planes, archons already resided in Heaven, the original inhabitants of the realm. Upon meeting, the archons and divine angels quickly discovered they were of a kind, holding justice and righteousness in their hearts. An alliance was formed, and archons now serve as stalwart allies to all celestials and mortals they find worthy. While the first archons coalesced from the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven, they choose willing and worthy Heaven-bound souls to join their ranks. These mortals hear and answer the call of a mysterious voice, manifesting in the Garden at the mountain's peak. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their new archon forms. Though deeply concerned with defending mortal life and willing to sacrifice themselves in battle against fiends, archons often feel rote and inscrutable to others, and their forms can border on frightening and bizarre. For this reason, they often have issues with interacting with mortals, or with the free spirited azatas. Despite this, archons draw great strength from others, especially those who exemplify virtue. Beyond their celestial allies, archons also maintain ancient ties with aeons. The inscrutable factions can still be seen working together to defend long- forgotten secrets and enforce rules that predate mortal life. Archons explain these missions as necessary without further elaboration, leaving even their angelic allies frustrated with archons' obstinance. Members Aesra (Creature 7), Giylea (Creature 16), Qarna (Creature 4), Rekhep (Creature 10), Zoaem (Creature 1) Archon Aesthetics While archons do not seek to gather or maintain wealth, they do appreciate beauty and art, and their domains are often decorated with valuable crafts and creative works. They themselves are similarly ornate, and they always take time for proper maintenance after battle. Archons value care—and thus tidiness—in all things. Archon Divinities As with angels and azatas, the most powerful archons count among a group of demigods known collectively as empyreal lords. Each archon empyreal lord is a unique and powerful creature who keeps a domain somewhere in Heaven and is worshipped on mortal worlds. Archon divinities serve a variety of goals and focus on different aspects of righteousness. Some, such as Arqueros, hold influence over the defense of the innocent, while others, like Damerrich, demigod of executions, emphasize the punishment of unrepentant wrongdoers and seek to obliterate evil in all its forms. Heavenly Mountain Though they can be found anywhere in their endless battle against fiends, archons originate in Heaven, a plane that appears as a single massive mountain.

Lizardfolk and xulgaths are fond of using dinosaurs as beasts of burden, mounts, or even war beasts. Certain dinosaurs, such as velociraptors and deinonychuses, make excellent trackers as well. The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In more bloodthirsty cultures, dinosaurs are sadly sometimes used as combatants in gladiatorial battles.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_5_TreasureAndRewards.png\">Dinosaur Resources</title>\r\n\r\nAs animals, dinosaurs have little interest in treasure (although velociraptors and deinonychuses, like their bird cousins, enjoy keeping sparkling baubles in their nests), but the remains of adventurers strewn about their lairs often still have valuable gear.

Some campaign settings might not contain entire isolated worlds within them, but many, such as Golarion, have expansive underground lands. The deepest region of the Darklands of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is an optimal region to find a hollow world. Typically infused with magic that allows for jungles to grow deep underground (and sometimes even featuring sunlike orbs that illuminate the lands from above, simulating a day-night cycle), areas such as Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect places for dinosaurs to roam.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Other Dinosaurs</title>\r\n\r\nA wide range of dinosaurs are presented on these pages, but any trip to the movies, exploration of dinosaur books, or online search reveals a wealth of additional creatures that could fit into your game as well.

Lizardfolk, orcs, giants, and other humanoids who live near dinosaurs use the animals as mounts, guards, or hunting beasts. Occasionally, rich nobles will collect dinosaurs to display them in menageries, which almost inevitably leads to cast-offs being nursed back to health by druids and other champions of nature. When dinosaurs establish themselves in regions outside their normal habitats, it's often the result of a large collection being released.

Lizardfolk and xulgaths are fond of using dinosaurs as beasts of burden, mounts, or even war beasts. Certain dinosaurs, such as velociraptors and deinonychuses, make excellent trackers as well. The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In more bloodthirsty cultures, dinosaurs are sadly sometimes used as combatants in gladiatorial battles. Dinosaur Resources As animals, dinosaurs have little interest in treasure (although velociraptors and deinonychuses, like their bird cousins, enjoy keeping sparkling baubles in their nests), but the remains of adventurers strewn about their lairs often still have valuable gear. Beyond these traditional treasures, local civilizations often hunt dinosaurs for meat, hides, and eggs. Dinosaurs in Fantasy At first glance, the inclusion of dinosaurs in a fantasy setting might seem strange, but dinosaurs are an excellent creature to use in a game that bridges the gap between familiar real-world animals and legendary monsters. If having dinosaurs mix freely with lions, manticores, and dragons still seems strange to you, consider using them in remote, primeval lands, as suggested in the sidebars below. Hollow Worlds Hollow worlds are another classic fictional location where dinosaurs can be found. Some campaign settings might not contain entire isolated worlds within them, but many, such as Golarion, have expansive underground lands. The deepest region of the Darklands of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is an optimal region to find a hollow world. Typically infused with magic that allows for jungles to grow deep underground (and sometimes even featuring sunlike orbs that illuminate the lands from above, simulating a day-night cycle), areas such as Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect places for dinosaurs to roam. Other Dinosaurs A wide range of dinosaurs are presented on these pages, but any trip to the movies, exploration of dinosaur books, or online search reveals a wealth of additional creatures that could fit into your game as well.

Primeval Lands Across Golarion, dinosaurs are found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus—sometimes called lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like carnivorous plants, drakes, linnorms, and rocs.

Residing in his home within the massive rift known as the First Blade's path, Trivorrin acts as a sort of arbiter for the various clans and tribes of the region. Anyone who brings offerings of technological wonders from across Numeria earns safe passage and protection from the dragon, making his home a neutral ground for clan politics. Trivorrin has been stockpiling technology for centuries in an attempt to build a secret invention of his own.

In addition to the typical riches, mirage dragons also keep mirrors in their hoards to better scratch their narcissistic itches. Mirage dragons tend to keep lairs in natural environments, which are better suited for their camouflage. These lairs are generally near lakes and other large bodies of water that serve as an additional natural mirror for the dragon.

While they're weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties— small social groups fittingly called “rampages”—makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders.\n\n Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them with their formidable jaws and thick- scaled tails to use in close combat. Most drakes would rather avoid this, however, preferring to use their magical breath to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.\n\n Different species of drakes rarely come into conflict. Part of this is their distinct habitats, but drakes are open to negotiating simple agreements between rampages. This courtesy does not extend to dragonets, which drakes happily take as prey. Solitary tamed drakes are also excluded from such agreements and considered free game if their tamer isn't strong enough to protect them. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Drake Eggs</title> While drake hides aren't any more valuable than those of similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. They are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, but the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.\n\n A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.\n\n A drake egg is an object with Hardness 3, 5 HP, and no Broken Threshold. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.\n\n Once a drake hatches, they imprint on the first creature that they see. A creature imprinted on in this way can use Nature to Train and Command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the type of drake and the exact legal situation. Because drakes are dangerous and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.\n\n It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Desert Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2963) (Creature 8), [Flame Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2959) (Creature 5), [Frost Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2962) (Creature 7), [Jungle Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2960) (Creature 6), [River Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2958) (Creature 3), [Wyvern](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2961) (Creature 6)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Drake Hunters</title>\r\n\r\nThe allure of hunting a dragon is difficult to resist for many adventurers, but accomplishing such a task is fraught with peril.

Malevolent Possession Two Actions The ghost attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the possession spell, except since the ghost doesn't have a physical body, it is unaffected by that restriction of the spell. Telekinetic Assault Two Actions (divine) The ghost cries out in pain and anguish as small objects and debris fly about in a 30-foot emanation. Creatures in this area take 1d6 bludgeoning damage + 1d6 per 2 levels the ghost has, with a basic Reflex save.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=418","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"creature-family-419","_score":4.226689,"_source":{"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Ghoul","creature_family_markdown":"Ghoul","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-419","legacy_id":["creature-family-52"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Ghoul](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=419)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 162 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\nFew creatures are more ubiquitous to sinister locations such as lonely graveyards and ruined crypts than the flesh-eating undead known as ghouls. \r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Ghoul Soldier](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3010) (Creature 2), [Ghoul Stalker](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3009) (Creature 1)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Ghoulish Society</title>\r\n\r\nGhouls are quite intelligent and, more so than almost any other undead, prone to forming societies and cultures (if vile and repugnant ones centered around flesh eating and other acts of depravity) in tangled warrens below boneyards, or even entire cities hidden away in the depths of the Darklands.\r\n</aside>\n\n<title level=\"2\">Creating Ghouls</title>\r\n\r\nThe monsters in this section are built from the ground up.

A graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating their armor (such as with disintegrate ), transporting it to the Forge of Creation, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano.

If the steed is destroyed, the graveknight must wait 1 hour before using this ability again. Ruinous Weapons When created, a graveknight chooses one of the following energy types that was relevant to their life or death: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Any weapon the graveknight wields or unarmed attack the graveknight uses gains the effects of the corrosive , frost , shock , or flaming weapon rune, respectively, in addition to a +1 striking weapon rune.

Hobgoblins are singularly devoted to war, and their entire culture is built upon fostering and maintaining conflict while simultaneously proving their superiority in battle. Hobgoblins are highly organized, and they work efficiently and effectively in groups, whether that group is a small raiding party, a roving war band, or a fully regimented army. Hobgoblin rulers require little provocation before declaring war, and more often than not, such wars are waged to gain resources or territory. Physically, hobgoblins stand about as tall as humans and have gray skin.\n\n Hobgoblin society is organized along military lines, and every hobgoblin is effectively a member of the army. Each hobgoblin in a community has a rank in the military hierarchy, and individuals are naturally ambitious and obsessed with advancement. Hobgoblins are constantly expected to prove that they're fearless, ruthless, cunning, and strong. Demonstrating such aptitudes to military leadership is an individual hobgoblin's best hope for promotion through the ranks, but failure leads only to cruel exploitation at the hands of their superiors.\n\n Though brutal, hobgoblin society is a true meritocracy, and all hobgoblins, regardless of age, gender, or birth, wield authority and earn respect from their peers based on their skill in battle. Even those individuals who serve in non-combat roles in hobgoblin society—blacksmiths, builders, cooks, messengers, quartermasters, and the like—know that they perform vital jobs that support the larger hobgoblin army, though they rarely rise above the rank of common soldier. Everyone contributes to the larger whole, ensuring that hobgoblin society is the strongest and most efficient it can be, and anyone who fails to do so is culled from the army and thus hobgoblin society as dead weight. Hobgoblins don't usually engage in trade with other ancestries, or even with other hobgoblin tribes, preferring to take what they want by force.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Hobgoblin Archer](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3054) (Creature 4), [Hobgoblin Battalion](/NPCs.aspx?ID=3649) (Creature 6), [Hobgoblin General](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3055) (Creature 6), [Hobgoblin Soldier](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3053) (Creature 1), [Hobgoblin Spellbreaker](/NPCs.aspx?ID=3648) (Creature 3), [Hobgoblin Vanguard](/NPCs.aspx?ID=3650) (Creature 8)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Growing Pains</title>\r\n\r\nAs a burgeoning nation, Oprak has had to find ways to clothe and feed its citizens in this time of relative peace. While hobgoblins are no strangers to pitching in for a war effort, most of the former soldiers are slowly adjusting to civilian jobs, such as farming and mining.

Hobgoblins are singularly devoted to war, and their entire culture is built upon fostering and maintaining conflict while simultaneously proving their superiority in battle. Hobgoblins are highly organized, and they work efficiently and effectively in groups, whether that group is a small raiding party, a roving war band, or a fully regimented army. Hobgoblin rulers require little provocation before declaring war, and more often than not, such wars are waged to gain resources or territory. Physically, hobgoblins stand about as tall as humans and have gray skin. Hobgoblin society is organized along military lines, and every hobgoblin is effectively a member of the army. Each hobgoblin in a community has a rank in the military hierarchy, and individuals are naturally ambitious and obsessed with advancement. Hobgoblins are constantly expected to prove that they're fearless, ruthless, cunning, and strong. Demonstrating such aptitudes to military leadership is an individual hobgoblin's best hope for promotion through the ranks, but failure leads only to cruel exploitation at the hands of their superiors. Though brutal, hobgoblin society is a true meritocracy, and all hobgoblins, regardless of age, gender, or birth, wield authority and earn respect from their peers based on their skill in battle. Even those individuals who serve in non-combat roles in hobgoblin society—blacksmiths, builders, cooks, messengers, quartermasters, and the like—know that they perform vital jobs that support the larger hobgoblin army, though they rarely rise above the rank of common soldier. Everyone contributes to the larger whole, ensuring that hobgoblin society is the strongest and most efficient it can be, and anyone who fails to do so is culled from the army and thus hobgoblin society as dead weight. Hobgoblins don't usually engage in trade with other ancestries, or even with other hobgoblin tribes, preferring to take what they want by force.

While hobgoblins are no strangers to pitching in for a war effort, most of the former soldiers are slowly adjusting to civilian jobs, such as farming and mining. They've made a few mistakes during the transition, the worst of which had them accidentally awaken a slumbering Darklands monster under the Mindspin Mountains. Hobgoblins and Magic Hobgoblins generally distrust magic, especially arcane magic, which they derisively call “elf magic.” In the absence of magic, they wholeheartedly embrace alchemy, combining it with their natural aptitude for engineering to great destructive effect. They cautiously accept divine magic, due to a grudging respect for the power of healing magic in times of war. Living with Hobgoblins With few exceptions, hobgoblin society has no place for those who don't share their blood. Hobgoblins occasionally make use of bugbears as assassins or spies, and most hobgoblin tribes include a small group of goblins who eke out a meager existence on the fringes of hobgoblin society.

They lurk in dark spaces, usually tunnels and mines beneath the earth, in either warrens of their own design or complexes discovered and colonized after the original builders have moved on. Though kobolds are far more pragmatic than courageous, they use every inch of their cunning to even the playing field between themselves and other, stronger creatures. They attack from the darkness and at range, and kobold artificers and engineers master the art of simple but effective traps, which they use to protect their lairs. Kobolds are skilled at working together by necessity, and they often set up ambushes or hit-and-run assaults that allow them to do the most damage possible without being harmed in return.\n\n Kobolds are diligent and hardworking creatures. While some kobolds live in communal collectives that maintain neutral relations with the creatures around them, they can be easily swayed into serving malevolent powers or megalomaniacal leaders.

First, a lich requires solitude to plan their elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as a lich's self-imposed isolation often drives them toward detachment and disdain for mortal life, further solidifying their separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner they become, secreting themself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion from powerful magic.

The lich's soul cage doesn't need to be present for the lich to use this ability.<br /> **Siphon Life** A lich's form draws forth life from those who come into contact with it. When the lich damages a living creature with an unarmed attack, the lich gains 5 temporary Hit Points and the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save against the lich's spell DC – 2 or become [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=68).

While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulfill some long-term plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulfill some malevolent purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter history—both for those who transform themselves and for the countless mortals who will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich's new power. Members Lich (Creature 12) Lich Lairs After their metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude to plan their elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as a lich's self-imposed isolation often drives them toward detachment and disdain for mortal life, further solidifying their separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner they become, secreting themself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion from powerful magic. Many liches sink into their own warped worldviews; the nature of a lich's lair is a good indicator of their outlook on life itself. Unique Lichdom The exact ritual, ingredients for deadly concoctions, and magical conditions required to become a lich are unique and different for every living creature. Understanding a spellcaster's path to lichdom can help, but is no guarantee of success for others. Creating a Lich A lich can be any type of spellcaster as long as they have the ability to perform a ritual of undeath as the primary caster (which can usually be performed only by a spellcaster capable of casting 6th-rank spells). To create a lich, increase the spellcaster's level by 1 and change their statistics as follows. It gains the undead trait and usually becomes unholy. It increases spell DCs and spell attack modifier by 2. Lich Abilities Liches lose all abilities that come from being a living creature. They also lose any traits that represented their life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. A lich gains the following abilities. Darkvision Saving Throws +1 status bonus to all saves vs. vitality Void Healing Rejuvenation (arcane) When a lich is destroyed, their soul immediately transfers to their soul cage . A lich can be permanently destroyed only if their soul cage is found and destroyed. Immunities bleed, death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious Resistances cold 10, physical 10 (except magical bludgeoning) Frightful Presence (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 60 feet, DC 30 Hand of the Lich All liches have a hand unarmed attack that deals 1d8 void damage for every 3 levels the lich has. This attack has the finesse trait. Drain Soul Cage Free Action Frequency once per day; Effect The lich taps into their soul cage's power to cast any arcane spell up to the highest rank the lich can cast, even if the spell being cast is not one of the lich's prepared spells. The lich's soul cage doesn't need to be present for the lich to use this ability. Siphon Life A lich's form draws forth life from those who come into contact with it. When the lich damages a living creature with an unarmed attack, the lich gains 5 temporary Hit Points and the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save against the lich's spell DC – 2 or become drained 1. If the lich is grabbed or restrained at the start of its turn, each creature grabbing or restraining it must succeed at a Fortitude save or become drained 1. If the lich siphons a creature's life again, the drained value increase by 1, to a maximum of drained 4. Alternate Lich Abilities You can create a more unusual lich by substituting any one of the following abilities for frightful presence, siphon life, or Drain Soul Cage. Blasphemous Utterances (arcane, aura, mental) 10 feet. The lich is accompanied by a constant echo of blasphemous murmurs and tainted whispers. A creature in the aura takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against mental effects and can't take actions that have the concentrate trait unless they succeed at a DC 10 flat check. On a failure, the action is disrupted. Cold Beyond Cold The lich's hand Strike deals cold damage instead of void and the target is slowed 2. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to slowed 1 (or negates it on a critical success). Dark Deliverance The lich has resistance equal to their level to vitality. Void Shroud (aura, death) 30 feet. The lich is surrounded by an aura of death, drawing forth souls to be consumed by the lich's constant hunger. Living creatures in the emanation take a –2 status penalty to saves against fear and death effects. In addition, any creature that starts its turn in the area gains the doomed 1 condition unless it succeeds at a Will save against the lich's spell DC – 4.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=438","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"creature-family-439","_score":4.226689,"_source":{"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Linnorm","creature_family_markdown":"Linnorm","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-439","legacy_id":["creature-family-69"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Linnorm](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=439)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 220 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\nImmense, primeval dragons of the northern reaches of the world, linnorms hate those they deem to be lesser creatures and seek to inflict as much suffering as possible upon their unfortunate victims.

Their head also resembles that of a bull or cow, though with eyes that brim with curiosity or fury, depending on the minotaur's temperament. Though often mistaken for aggressive brutes due to their size and reputation, many minotaurs are skilled artisans who spend much of their lives perfecting their craft. Minotaur communities tend to be insular and are found at the heart of a cunning labyrinth or within a tangle of underground caverns.\n\n The myth many minotaurs like to tell of their origin involves a stonemason living in ancient Iblydos. After accidentally insulting a hero-god, he was cursed to become the first minotaur.

They often take the form of beautiful humanoids with elven features that match their abodes. The most common of their kind are the dryads: spirits who embody great trees, but many other kinds of nymphs exist, including naiads, who watch over bodies of water. All nymphs are guardians of some element of nature, often a single tree or pond. But, in the case of nymph queens, they can watch over whole forests or massive bodies of water.\n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Nymph Queens</title> Nymph queens are powerful nymphs who rule over entire regions of untouched wilderness, not just single trees or ponds. Every variety of nymph can have a queen. Naiad queens are among the most prominent, and more often interact with nearby mortals. Thus, some scholars refer to naiad queens as simply “nymphs.” \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Nymph Queen Abilities</title> A nymph queen is 6 to 10 levels higher than an ordinary nymph of the same type, with enhanced numerical statistics and improved Strikes to match. A nymph queen's ward is a significant region, and she strengthens and vivifies this territory with her presence. Nymph queens are not dependent on their wards and lose the corresponding ability (such as a dryad's tree dependent ability); instead, they gain the tied to the land ability, as described below. A nymph queen also gains the nymph's beauty aura and the Focus Beauty action, which have varying effects based on the queen's original type. She gains the Inspiration ability, allowing her to bestow a gift of inspiration on those who catch her fancy, and the Change Shape ability to change her form. Finally, she gains primal prepared spells as a [druid](/Classes.aspx?ID=6) of her level.\n\n **Tied to the Land** A nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a specific region. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to [counteract](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) any spell that would harm the environment (such as the [_blight_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=111) ritual), using her spell DC with a counteract rank equal to the highest-rank druid spell she can cast. When the nymph queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the nymph queen swiftly heals the entire region.<br /> **Nymph's Beauty** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=542), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=590), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=676), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=727)) 30 feet. Creatures that start their turn in the aura must succeed at a Will save or suffer an effect described in the nymph queen's entry.<br /> **[Change Shape](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=55)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=670), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=676)) Nymph queens can transform between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and any Small or Medium [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=628) form, typically choosing a more humanoid-looking version of their natural form.<br /> **Focus Beauty** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=590), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=676), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=727)) The nymph queen focuses her beauty upon a target, who must attempt a save against her nymph's beauty aura. If the creature fails and was already affected by the aura, it takes a greater effect described in the nymph queen's entry. A nymph queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature only once per turn.<br /> **Inspiration** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=590), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=676)) The nymph queen inspires a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair, though it can be some other significant object as well. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with her, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=37) checks, [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=45) checks, and Will saves.<br /> If the nymph grants her token to a [bard](/Classes.aspx?ID=3), and she's the bard's muse, the queen chooses one additional benefit granted by her token: a +1 status bonus to all [Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=41) checks, a +2 status bonus to Performance checks when determining the effects of compositions, a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks, or a +2 status bonus to Will saves against [fey](/Traits.aspx?ID=599).\n\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Dryad](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3112) (Creature 3), [Dryad Queen](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3114) (Creature 13), [Naiad](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3111) (Creature 1), [Naiad Queen](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3113) (Creature 7)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_5_TreasureAndRewards.png\">Artistic Treasures</title>\r\n\r\nNymphs favor art over any other types of material possession, often collecting the finest pieces they can and endeavoring to create their own. Nymphs sometimes carry magical trinkets or wear enchanted clothing or jewelry, but the greatest treasure a nymph queen can share is often her inspiration to those seeking a muse.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_3_Locations.png\">Harmonious Landscapes</title>\r\n\r\nNymphs tend to be closely associated with specific areas of natural splendor and beauty—woodlands for dryads, rivers for naiads.

They often take the form of beautiful humanoids with elven features that match their abodes. The most common of their kind are the dryads: spirits who embody great trees, but many other kinds of nymphs exist, including naiads, who watch over bodies of water. All nymphs are guardians of some element of nature, often a single tree or pond. But, in the case of nymph queens, they can watch over whole forests or massive bodies of water. Nymph Queens Nymph queens are powerful nymphs who rule over entire regions of untouched wilderness, not just single trees or ponds. Every variety of nymph can have a queen. Naiad queens are among the most prominent, and more often interact with nearby mortals. Thus, some scholars refer to naiad queens as simply “nymphs.” Nymph Queen Abilities A nymph queen is 6 to 10 levels higher than an ordinary nymph of the same type, with enhanced numerical statistics and improved Strikes to match. A nymph queen's ward is a significant region, and she strengthens and vivifies this territory with her presence. Nymph queens are not dependent on their wards and lose the corresponding ability (such as a dryad's tree dependent ability); instead, they gain the tied to the land ability, as described below. A nymph queen also gains the nymph's beauty aura and the Focus Beauty action, which have varying effects based on the queen's original type. She gains the Inspiration ability, allowing her to bestow a gift of inspiration on those who catch her fancy, and the Change Shape ability to change her form. Finally, she gains primal prepared spells as a druid of her level. Tied to the Land A nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a specific region. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to counteract any spell that would harm the environment (such as the blight ritual), using her spell DC with a counteract rank equal to the highest-rank druid spell she can cast. When the nymph queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the nymph queen swiftly heals the entire region. Nymph's Beauty (aura, emotion, mental, primal, visual) 30 feet. Creatures that start their turn in the aura must succeed at a Will save or suffer an effect described in the nymph queen's entry. Change Shape Single Action (polymorph, primal) Nymph queens can transform between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and any Small or Medium humanoid form, typically choosing a more humanoid-looking version of their natural form. Focus Beauty Single Action (emotion, mental, primal, visual) The nymph queen focuses her beauty upon a target, who must attempt a save against her nymph's beauty aura. If the creature fails and was already affected by the aura, it takes a greater effect described in the nymph queen's entry. A nymph queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature only once per turn. Inspiration Three Actions (emotion, mental, primal) The nymph queen inspires a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair, though it can be some other significant object as well. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with her, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks, Performance checks, and Will saves. If the nymph grants her token to a bard, and she's the bard's muse, the queen chooses one additional benefit granted by her token: a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks, a +2 status bonus to Performance checks when determining the effects of compositions, a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks, or a +2 status bonus to Will saves against fey. Members Dryad (Creature 3), Dryad Queen (Creature 13), Naiad (Creature 1), Naiad Queen (Creature 7) Artistic Treasures Nymphs favor art over any other types of material possession, often collecting the finest pieces they can and endeavoring to create their own. Nymphs sometimes carry magical trinkets or wear enchanted clothing or jewelry, but the greatest treasure a nymph queen can share is often her inspiration to those seeking a muse. Harmonious Landscapes Nymphs tend to be closely associated with specific areas of natural splendor and beauty—woodlands for dryads, rivers for naiads. Areas where nymphs dwell always look more pristine, breathtaking, and scenic than they would otherwise. Inspirations for Art Nymphs are living manifestations of beauty and grace, and as such they are often the subjects of art—sculpture and paintings in particular. Promising a nymph to immortalize them in a work of art can be an excellent way to secure that nymph's favor, but one should take care to ensure that the nymph admires and is proud of the artistic effort's final result, lest the nymph be insulted and lash out with her powerful magic. Other Nymphs Naiads and dryads are the most well-known nymphs, but others exist as well. Hesperides, for example, are warders of the sunset and golden light and can be encountered dwelling on coastal cliffsides or remote islands. Lampads, on the other hand, are dark, moody nymphs found in wondrous, crystal-lined caverns deep underground.

As they live lives that are frequently cut brutally short, orcs revel in testing their strength against worthy foes, whether by challenging a higher-ranking member of their community for dominance, taming a powerful beast, or slaying a fearsome monster. Tall and powerful, with long arms and thickly muscled legs, many orcs top 7 feet in height. Their heavy limbs and broad, almost bow-legged stances combine with a tendency to slouch forward to create an almost contradictory set of circumstances where an orc can tower over other humanoids while simultaneously staring them in the eye. These features, alongside a tendency to scar easily, can make them seem quite intimidating. The half-orc dromaars, most commonly born of unions between orcs and humans, are often tested even more harshly than their full orc kin, but those who endure these tests can rise to positions of authority. “An orc can have what an orc can hold” is a saying that not only applies to an individual's ability to secure their own destiny and position, but is also likely the root of orcs referring to their communities as holds.

Others note that the serpentine form is one of the most primeval shapes, perhaps suggesting that in a reality at the dawn of time, such shapes were all that could exist. The proteans themselves have little to say on the matter, which, perhaps ironically, only adds to the confusion and lack of consensus surrounding their kind. After all, if even chaos cannot be trusted to be chaotic, would that not be the purest form of entropy? Warpwaves Many proteans can subject their foes to warpwaves—disorienting alterations in perceived time and space—by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment. When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the specific effect on that creature. Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect lasts for 1d4 rounds, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature. ## d8 Warpwave Effect 1 Clumsy 2 (3 on a critical failure) 2 Confused and gains 4d6 temporary Hit Points 3 Dazzled (permanent on a critical failure) 4 Enfeebled 2 (3 on a critical failure) 5 Immobilized by filaments of energy 6 Quickened (Stride, Strike, or Step only) 7 Slowed 1 8 Stupefied 2 (3 on a critical failure) Members Azuretzi (Creature 5), Keketar (Creature 17), Voidworm (Creature 1) Ancient Immortals Among the numerous types of immortals that dwell in the Great Beyond, the proteans are surely some of the oldest. They've waged war against the inevitable aeons from the advent of their first creation and speak longingly of that time before the gods themselves imposed order upon reality Born From Chaos The Maelstrom, home of all proteans, is the whirling mass of turbulent primal energy, planar waves, and soul-stuff that surrounds the Outer Planes. Planar scholars theorize that all of reality was originally formed from the Maelstrom in the early days of the cosmos—a theory proteans don't necessarily dispute. Defending Chaos Where proteans go, chaos follows. To proteans, there is no purer form of existence than entropy, and they constantly seek to oppose the establishment of order in the Great Beyond. However, proteans don't see life as being incompatible with chaos; rather, they simply believe beings— immortal or not—deserve complete freedom on their own terms. Other Proteans Many other proteans beyond those presented here dwell in the Maelstrom, including knowledge-corrupting akizendris, physically threatening naunets, spectral pelagastrs, nearly humanoid shapechanging ourdivars, and incredibly powerful izfiitars. Protean Divinities The most powerful of all proteans are a group of demigods known collectively as protean lords. Yet even their vast might pales in comparison to that of the mysterious Speakers of the Depths. The Speakers are the most enigmatic of the Maelstrom'sgods—even their exact nature is unknown, and scholars disagree as to whether they are even divinities or just aspects of the Maelstrom itself. Protean Names Individual proteans have two names: a traditional name in their hissing, confusing language; and an honorary title. The latter is easily translated to other languages, but a protean's traditional name can only rarely be uttered in any tongue other than Protean. As such, most proteans tend to go by their titles when dealing with outsiders, referring to themselves as, for example, “Song of Gentle Poison” or “Sibilant Cry of the Storm.” ","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=457","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"creature-family-458","_score":4.226689,"_source":{"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Psychopomp","creature_family_markdown":"Psychopomp","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-458","legacy_id":["creature-family-83"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Psychopomp](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=458)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 274 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\nPsychopomps are guardians and shepherds of the dead in the [Boneyard](/Planes.aspx?ID=39), the vast plane of graves where mortal souls are judged and sent on to their eternal rewards or damnations.

Their power was shattered and their god [Ydersius](/Deities.aspx?ID=211) decapitated (although not quite slain). The cunning, intelligence, and magical abilities of serpentfolk have diminished from their ancient heights, and most are born without these boons. This is partially the result of cruel genetic meddling among serpentfolk—though the ruling class, zyss, are born with an innate spellcasting ability, their blood runs thin, making them susceptible to wounds. Seen as the failures of the serpentfolk's experiments are the aapophs, who are strong but prone to mutation and lack innate spellcasting.\n\n Today, the central realm of the Darklands retains the old name of the serpentfolk empire that once dominated this region—Sekamina. This name is also the source of the serpentfolk's [Aklo](/Languages.aspx?ID=164) title, sekmin, which they are often called in ancient texts. Serpentfolk dominion had declined before ghouls, gugs, umbral gnomes, and other forces. Yet their recent ventures have brought them back to a stronger place in the Darklands. Many serpentfolk sleeping in torpor in secluded vaults have awakened.\n\n Zyss serpentfolk tend toward megalomania, with dreams of returning to their place of dominance. Many of their plans hinge on resurrecting Ydersius, their decapitated god. His headless body still thrashes about, mindless, in the Darklands, waiting to be reunited with his lost skull. Serpentfolk numbers are so small that reclaiming their dominance seems a distant dream, especially since their reproduction is slow. Though a parent can birth a dozen young at once, the gestation period lasts up to a decade, and the likelihood that even one will be zyss is low. There's no telling whether a child will be zyss or aapoph, regardless of parentage. A coveted zyss child is just as likely to arise from aapoph parents as from two zyss, and every serpentfolk colony has someone in charge of sorting the young, identifying the earliest signs of magic in them.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Aapoph Granitescale](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3184) (Creature 6), [Aapoph Serpentfolk](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3182) (Creature 3), [Bone Prophet](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3185) (Creature 8), [Coil Spy](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3183) (Creature 4), [Zyss Serpentfolk](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3181) (Creature 2)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Above the Surface</title>\r\n\r\nA small number of serpentfolk settlements dot Golarion's surface, most of them in humid, remote jungles, far-flung islands, or at the mouths of caverns. It's rare for such a settlement to number more than a few dozen serpentfolk. They rely primarily on aapophs to build their power bases, to defend them, and to perform essentially all the practical functions of their society. This includes providing food, crafting goods, and tending to the zyss's every need.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Serpentfolk Magic</title>\r\n\r\nSome serpentfolk might have entirely different innate spells.

Their power was shattered and their god Ydersius decapitated (although not quite slain). The cunning, intelligence, and magical abilities of serpentfolk have diminished from their ancient heights, and most are born without these boons. This is partially the result of cruel genetic meddling among serpentfolk—though the ruling class, zyss, are born with an innate spellcasting ability, their blood runs thin, making them susceptible to wounds. Seen as the failures of the serpentfolk's experiments are the aapophs, who are strong but prone to mutation and lack innate spellcasting. Today, the central realm of the Darklands retains the old name of the serpentfolk empire that once dominated this region—Sekamina. This name is also the source of the serpentfolk's Aklo title, sekmin, which they are often called in ancient texts. Serpentfolk dominion had declined before ghouls, gugs, umbral gnomes, and other forces. Yet their recent ventures have brought them back to a stronger place in the Darklands. Many serpentfolk sleeping in torpor in secluded vaults have awakened. Zyss serpentfolk tend toward megalomania, with dreams of returning to their place of dominance. Many of their plans hinge on resurrecting Ydersius, their decapitated god. His headless body still thrashes about, mindless, in the Darklands, waiting to be reunited with his lost skull. Serpentfolk numbers are so small that reclaiming their dominance seems a distant dream, especially since their reproduction is slow. Though a parent can birth a dozen young at once, the gestation period lasts up to a decade, and the likelihood that even one will be zyss is low. There's no telling whether a child will be zyss or aapoph, regardless of parentage. A coveted zyss child is just as likely to arise from aapoph parents as from two zyss, and every serpentfolk colony has someone in charge of sorting the young, identifying the earliest signs of magic in them. Members Aapoph Granitescale (Creature 6), Aapoph Serpentfolk (Creature 3), Bone Prophet (Creature 8), Coil Spy (Creature 4), Zyss Serpentfolk (Creature 2) Above the Surface A small number of serpentfolk settlements dot Golarion's surface, most of them in humid, remote jungles, far-flung islands, or at the mouths of caverns. It's rare for such a settlement to number more than a few dozen serpentfolk. They rely primarily on aapophs to build their power bases, to defend them, and to perform essentially all the practical functions of their society. This includes providing food, crafting goods, and tending to the zyss's every need. Serpentfolk Magic Some serpentfolk might have entirely different innate spells. These alternative spells are typically illusions, mental spells, or divinatory magic.

Aapoph serpentfolk lack innate spells. Zyss Strife A serpentfolk conclave with just a few zyss is functional, but one with a large number becomes fractious. Cults and societies form, all pursuing their own passions and politics, with scheming and backstabbing running rampant. A powerful priest may be able to bring other zyss to heel, but many zyss question why a priest should be in charge if their god is dead. Thriving on decadence, zyss crave receiving expensive gifts, gorging themselves on massive meals, and pursing arts such as music, poetry, or sculpture.

Bloody A coating of blood gives the skeleton fast healing equal to its level. Collapse Reaction Trigger The skeleton is critically hit; Effect The skeleton collapses into a pile of bones and the attack deals only normal damage. The skeleton can re-form in a standing position as an action, but until it does, it is immobilized and off-guard. Explosive Death When the skeleton is destroyed, its bones shatter and explode. Adjacent creatures take 1d6 slashing damage per 2 levels (minimum 1d6) with a basic Reflex save against the moderate spell DC for the skeleton's level.

The roots of these stories are undoubtedly true. Trolls' flesh endlessly regrows, going so far as to sprout aberrant limbs or additional heads if not pruned, and a bottomless hunger is required to feed such unfettered growth. Even in the process of glutting themselves, however, trolls find opportunities to taunt their prey and inflict petty cruelties.\n\n A troll's ability to survive is so strong that they believe even the smallest scrap of flesh will slowly regenerate into a new form, suffering as all the powers of the land are gathered to revive them. Despite the pain, trolls speak of this unassailable vitality as a blessing from their creator. Few trolls have heard the laughter of demons who claim that creator cursed the trolls and cast them down from lofty heights, binding them so they could never rise again. Trolls prefer to remain solitary, keeping every scrap of food for themselves.\n\n In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead groups of trolls. Such warleaders possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem.

The roots of these stories are undoubtedly true. Trolls' flesh endlessly regrows, going so far as to sprout aberrant limbs or additional heads if not pruned, and a bottomless hunger is required to feed such unfettered growth. Even in the process of glutting themselves, however, trolls find opportunities to taunt their prey and inflict petty cruelties. A troll's ability to survive is so strong that they believe even the smallest scrap of flesh will slowly regenerate into a new form, suffering as all the powers of the land are gathered to revive them. Despite the pain, trolls speak of this unassailable vitality as a blessing from their creator. Few trolls have heard the laughter of demons who claim that creator cursed the trolls and cast them down from lofty heights, binding them so they could never rise again. Trolls prefer to remain solitary, keeping every scrap of food for themselves. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead groups of trolls. Such warleaders possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem.

If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=627) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=628). You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme, such as powers that rely on sunlight or which assume the presence of vitality.\n\n **[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59)**<br /> [**Void Healing**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=83)<br /> **Immunities** [death ](/Traits.aspx?ID=571)effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=578), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=669), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=696)<br /> **Coffin Restoration** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [void](/Traits.aspx?ID=510)) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95). If their body rests in their coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which their fast healing begins to function normally.<br /> **Vampire Vulnerabilities** All vampires possess the following vulnerabilities. \n<ul><li>**Compulsions** Vampires are creatures with strange and unknowable compulsions. A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless they're transported while they hide within their coffin, nor can they enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions—a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome their compulsion just as they do their revulsion (see below).</li><li>**Revulsion** A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished [religious symbol](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2745) of a deity with a holy sanctification option. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so, and it remains brandished for 1 round (similar to [Raising a Shield](/Actions.aspx?ID=2316)). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=74) condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a vampire can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the [concentrate ](/Traits.aspx?ID=561)trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li><li>**Stake** A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a  vampire requires 3 actions and works only if the vampire is [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95). If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with [_holy water_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3001) while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li><li>**Sunlight** If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes [slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=92). The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight. If the vampire loses all their actions in this way, they're destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors.</li></ul> **Climb Speed** Vampires gain a climb Speed equal to their land Speed.<br /> **Claws** If the creature had hands, their fingernails thicken and grow, granting them an [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719) claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=526) trait. If the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by their claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If they had only non-agile attacks, their claws should deal three-quarters that damage.<br /> **Drink Blood** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579)) **Requirements** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=77), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=90), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95), or willing creature is within the vampire's reach; **Effect** The vampire sinks their fangs into that creature to drink their blood. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=36) check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=68) and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary HP. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drained value by 1, killing the victim when it reaches drained 5. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no HP from doing so.<br /> A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.<br /> **Grab** The creature's claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=45). \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">True Vampire Abilities</title> Powerful vampires that can create and control vampires from their victims gain additional vampire abilities, as detailed below. A creature below level 5 is not a significant enough creature to become a true vampire—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular vampire servitor or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 5 before becoming a true vampire.\n\n **Resistances** The vampire resists all physical damage except magical silver.<br /> **Create Servitor** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [downtime](/Traits.aspx?ID=580)) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire servitor by donating some of their own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. A vampiric servitor is compelled to obey its creator, but if a vampire controls too many vampiric servitors at once (as determined by the GM), or if the servitor is a higher level than the vampire that created it, strong-willed servitors can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.<br /> **Mist Escape** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> **Trigger** The vampire is reduced to 0 HP; **Effect** The vampire uses Turn to Mist. They can take [move](/Traits.aspx?ID=658) actions to move toward their coffin even though they're at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. They automatically return to their corporeal form, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95), if they reach their coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.<br /> **[Change Shape](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=55)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=670)) The vampire transforms into one of their animal forms or back into their normal form. Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the [_aerial form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1437) and [_animal form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1440) spells as guidelines. \n<ul><li>**Bat** The vampire changes into a [bat swarm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=45) or [giant bat](/Monsters.aspx?ID=46). They gain echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as their highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage.</li></ul> **Children of the Night** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647)) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include rat swarms, bat swarms, and wolves but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they're within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.<br /> **Dominate** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=631), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=727)) The vampire can cast [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1501) at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=727) trait. The save DC uses the [high spell DC of the vampire's level](/Rules.aspx?ID=2899), and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.<br /> **Drink Blood** As a typical vampire, but the victim is [drained 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=68) instead of 1.<br /> **Turn to Mist** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([air](/Traits.aspx?ID=527), [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=670)) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the [_vapor form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1738) spell, or back to their normal form. The vampire loses [fast healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=62) while turned to mist. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.

A vampire who lives in a city with active nightlife may maintain their mortal guise for many years before their undead nature becomes apparent, while vampires from simpler towns and villages may stalk nearby woods and caverns, yearning for a life forever denied them. Creating a Vampire You can turn an existing living creature into a vampire using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually the unholy trait. Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a limited or infrequent number of times (such as a dragon's breath), increase the damage by 2 instead. Reduce its HP by the amount listed on the table. The vampire gains fast healing and resistance to physical damage (except silver) as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the vampire has fewer Hit Points. Starting Level HP Decrease Fast Healing/Resistance 3–4 –20 5 5–7 –30 7 8–14 –40 10 15+ –60 15 Basic Vampire Abilities All vampires gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme, such as powers that rely on sunlight or which assume the presence of vitality. Darkvision Void Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep Coffin Restoration (divine, void) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall unconscious. If their body rests in their coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which their fast healing begins to function normally. Vampire Vulnerabilities All vampires possess the following vulnerabilities. Compulsions Vampires are creatures with strange and unknowable compulsions. A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless they're transported while they hide within their coffin, nor can they enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions—a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome their compulsion just as they do their revulsion (see below). Revulsion A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a deity with a holy sanctification option. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so, and it remains brandished for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the fleeing condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a vampire can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). Stake A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a vampire requires 3 actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed. Sunlight If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes slowed 1. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight. If the vampire loses all their actions in this way, they're destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors. Climb Speed Vampires gain a climb Speed equal to their land Speed. Claws If the creature had hands, their fingernails thicken and grow, granting them an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the agile trait. If the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by their claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If they had only non-agile attacks, their claws should deal three-quarters that damage. Drink Blood Single Action (divine) Requirements A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vampire's reach; Effect The vampire sinks their fangs into that creature to drink their blood. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is drained 1 and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary HP. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drained value by 1, killing the victim when it reaches drained 5. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no HP from doing so. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes. Grab The creature's claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain Grab. True Vampire Abilities Powerful vampires that can create and control vampires from their victims gain additional vampire abilities, as detailed below. A creature below level 5 is not a significant enough creature to become a true vampire—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular vampire servitor or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 5 before becoming a true vampire. Resistances The vampire resists all physical damage except magical silver. Create Servitor (divine, downtime) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire servitor by donating some of their own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. A vampiric servitor is compelled to obey its creator, but if a vampire controls too many vampiric servitors at once (as determined by the GM), or if the servitor is a higher level than the vampire that created it, strong-willed servitors can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC. Mist Escape Free Action Trigger The vampire is reduced to 0 HP; Effect The vampire uses Turn to Mist. They can take move actions to move toward their coffin even though they're at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. They automatically return to their corporeal form, unconscious, if they reach their coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first. Change Shape Single Action (concentrate, divine, polymorph) The vampire transforms into one of their animal forms or back into their normal form. Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the aerial form and animal form spells as guidelines. Bat The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat. They gain echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as their highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage. Children of the Night (divine, mental) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include rat swarms, bat swarms, and wolves but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they're within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back. Dominate Two Actions (divine, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses the high spell DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell. Drink Blood As a typical vampire, but the victim is drained 2 instead of 1. Turn to Mist Single Action (air, concentrate, divine, polymorph) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the vapor form spell, or back to their normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while turned to mist. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.

You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of the werecreature. Senses The werecreature gains all the senses of the animal. Animal Empathy The werecreature can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with animals of its general kind. Claws The werecreature gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing damage).

If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.

If it had any non-agile attacks, the damage dealt by its jaws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only agile attacks, its jaws should deal one-third more damage. Change Shape Single Action (concentrate, polymorph, primal) The werecreature changes into its humanoid, hybrid, or animal shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. A true werecreature's natural form is its hybrid shape. In humanoid shape, the werecreature uses its original humanoid size, loses its jaws and claws Strikes, and gains a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the slashing damage dealt by its claw. In animal shape, its Speed and size change to that of the animal, it gains any special Strike effects of the animal that it didn't already have (such as Grab), and it loses its weapon Strikes. Curse of the Werecreature (curse, primal) This curse affects only humanoids; Saving Throw Fortitude DC is the moderate spell DC for the werecreature's new level. On each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another Fortitude save or turn into the same kind of werecreature until dawn.

Any servitor of the divine may be slain in battle or through misadventure. In some cases, a slain servitor's body vanishes and is replaced by a powerful treasure. In others, the body itself simply crumples to the ground as a corpse. Servitors can be restored to life at a deity's whim, yet in many cases their deity won't immediately grant this resurrection and may simply seek to create or elevate an entirely different servitor. Should the unthinkable happen and a deity themselves perish, their existing servitors do not die but are immediately aware of the fact that their creator has ceased to be. Some myths tell of servitors who have then gone on to ascend in power and replace their creator as a demigod or even a deity themselves, while in other stories, a desperate servitor may seek out a new god or goddess to devote themselves to.\n\n While servitors are all unique creatures, in most cases they were once mortal worshippers—be they humanoid or otherwise—who have particularly pleased their deity. The resulting powers and abilities granted to the servitor vary wildly, but it's almost unheard of for a servitor of any deity to be less powerful than 15th level, or at least a few levels above what they possessed in their previous life.

Swapping Deities You can customize an acolyte, zealot, priest, or other NPC tied to a specific deity to match another deity. Change the NPC's sanctification to match the new deity. Add the deity's divine skill at the highest skill modifier the PC has. You can optionally remove the old deity's divine skill. Change their weapon to the new deity's favored weapon. You can usually leave the weapon damage as-is. If the NPC has multiple harm or heal spells at their top spell rank (mimicking a cleric's divine font), change that spell to match the new deity's font. If the NPC has the healing hands ability, change it to selective energy. Selective Energy When the devotee casts a version of harm or heal that has an area, they can designate up to 5 creatures in the area. Those creatures are not targeted by the spell. Swap some spells out for devotee spells or others that match the new deity's style. You can swap out domain spells if you choose, but this is a more involved process, and it's best to reference Player Core (see domains and domain spells here). For information on deity mechanics, see the deitiy table here. Deity Swap Example To make a priest of Urgathoa, you would make the following changes to the priest of Sarenrae, following the bullet points above. Change the holy trait to unholy. Add Intimidation +14 and remove Medicine +14. Change their scimitar to a scythe. You can change the 1d6+7 damage to the equivalent 1d10+5 if you want to use the scythe's normal damage die.

To build encounters including such creatures, you can either adapt an existing construct (such as an animated object) or change an animal's trait to construct and give it immunity to bleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, spirit, unconscious, vitality, and void. You might want to reduce its HP slightly to compensate. Misfires Firearms that are improperly maintained or subjected to unusual strain can misfire. If a creature attempts to fire a firearm that was fired the previous day or earlier and hasn't been cleaned since, it rolls a DC 5 flat check before making its attack roll. If it fails this misfire check, the weapon misfires and jams. The attack is an automatic critical failure, and a creature must use an Interact action to clear the jam before the weapon can be reloaded and fired again. Once a creature has spent at least an hour cleaning a weapon, no one needs to roll for a misfire for that weapon until the next day unless an effect says otherwise.

Alternate Moves Martial artists rarely have the same repertoire. For variety, use the following table to tweak an NPC's stats: NPC Ability Replace With Martial Student Fancy Footwork Hi-yah! Tournament Combatant Work the Crowd Competitive Taunt Mixed Martial Artist Any Stance Shift option Constant Feint Stance Black Belt Blocking Counterattack Defensive Side Kick Grandmaster One-Millimeter Punch Blazing Gate Blazing Gate Two Actions (electricity) Requirements The grandmaster has a target grappled or restrained; Effect The grandmaster tosses their target upwards and electrocutes them with a qi-infused double palm strike as they land. The target becomes prone, loses the grappled or restrained condition, and takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 persistent electricity damage (DC 38 basic Fortitude save). Competitive Taunt Single Action (emotion, fear, mental) The tournament combatant attempts to Demoralize a target. On a success, the demoralized creature is off-guard until the end of their next turn. The tournament combatant gets a +2 circumstance bonus to their damage against a creature made off-guard in this way. Constant Feint Stance This stance option replaces a different Stance Shift option (usually Secure Grapple Stance). +2 to attempts to Feint. If the mixed martial artist rolls a critical failure to Feint, they get a failure instead. If they successfully Feint, they can use Stance Shift as a free action. Unlike other stances, in this stance the mixed martial artist can't make Strikes. Defensive Side Kick Reaction Trigger A creature within the black belt's reach uses a move action; Effect The black belt makes a fist Strike designed to intercept and create distance. This Strike does not count towards the black belt's multiple attack penalty, and the black belt's multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike. On a successful hit, the target is pushed 5 feet away. Kiai! Free Action Frequency once per turn; Requirements The martial student attempts a Strike; Effect The martial student shouts to startle their adversary. If the Strike is successful, the target becomes frightened 1. Dirty Fighting Sometimes it doesn't pay to fight fair. You can give one of these dirty fighting tactics to any martial artist NPC. While tournament combatants are especially likely to look for an edge that will let them win, most black belts and grandmasters are unlikely to stoop to such chicanery. Concealed Spikes Reaction Trigger The martial artist critically succeeds on an unarmed Strike; Effect Tiny spikes in the martial artist's gloves or footwear deal an additional 1d6 persistent bleed damage. Contraband Substance Single Action The martial artist pulls out a concealed alchemical vial of mutagen and drinks it to improve their combat prowess. The item is usually a juggernaut mutagen, or quicksilver mutagen. This ability can't be used again until the martial artist has time to acquire and hide a new mutagen. Some martial artists use concealed small vials, but others hide a syringe or soak the alchemical liquid into a garment they can put in their mouth.

On a success, the martial artist deals 2d6 piercing damage (or double on a critical success). Sand In Your Eye Single Action (visual) The martial artist Feints.

Grandmaster Forbidden Knowledge Grandmasters study techniques outlawed for their tendency to maim both the user and the victim. If the Forbidden Palm doesn't suit your grandmaster's style, swap it for one of the following moves—if you dare. Life Burn Aura Three Actions (aura, force) The grandmaster transmutes their lifespan into an expulsion of qi. For the next minute, the grandmaster is surrounded by a 30-foot emanation that deals 3d6 force damage to all creatures who start their turn within the emanation, including the grandmaster themself. While Life Burn Aura is active, the grandmaster's fist Strikes deal 2 additional die of weapon damage. When the aura disappears, the grandmaster is permanently doomed 1. This condition is cumulative. Solar Surge Three Actions (visual) The grandmaster unleashes a qi wave as bright as the sun. All creatures within a 50-foot radius of the grandmaster who can see must attempt a DC 38 Reflex save, including the grandmaster themself. Critical Success The creature is dazzled for 1 round. Success The creature is blinded for 1 round. Failure The creature is blinded for 1 day. Critical Failure The creature is permanently blinded. Super Qi Blast Single Action (force, spellshape, polymorph); The grandmaster's body expands as it prepares to exude an unfathomable amount of qi.

Guerrilla Adjustments Most military engagements take place in large areas, such as plains or cities, where there is the most territory or resources to be gained. However, guerrilla units fight in forests, swamps, and other tough locations, where they set up traps, ambushes, and use other surprise tactics. You can use these adjustments to turn a military NPC or troop into a guerrilla. These can also be useful for mercenaries or other non-military NPCs. Give the creature a Stealth modifier equal to the high skill value for its level. If you're in a hurry, use the creature's highest skill modifier. If the creature has the Athletics skill, reduce its modifier by 2. Reduce the damage of the creature's Strikes by 2, but give it the Sneak Attack ability. Sneak Attack The creature deals 1d6 extra precision damage to off-guard creatures. Add the Pounce ability. Pounce Single Action The creature Strides and makes a Strike at the end of that movement. If the creature began this action hidden, they remain hidden until after this ability's Strike. Troop Formations Battle can be a complicated affair. Different situations call for varied arrangement of soldiers. You can add the Change Formation ability to a troop to give it more options, typically choosing two or three of the possible formations listed here. Troops with animal Intelligence (–4 or lower) or that aren't battle trained are typically unable to change formation without an outside force commanding them. Change Formation Two Actions (concentrate, move) The troop reconfigures to assume one of the formations below they know. Using this action again ends any previous formation, and the troop can also use this action to revert to its default formation, ending any benefits and drawbacks. Loose Members of the troop fan out to cover more ground. Benefit Any weaknesses the troop has to area and splash damage are suppressed. Drawback Enemies' saving throws against the troop's damaging effects are one degree of success better than they roll. Marching Column This formation traverses long distances more rapidly. Benefit The troop gains a +10 foot circumstance bonus to all its Speeds. Drawback The troop is off-guard and takes a –2 penalty to Reflex saves. Turtle Shell The troop interlocks their shields. Only a group with shields can use this formation. Benefit The troop gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks and to Reflex saves. Drawback The troop takes a –10-foot penalty to all its Speeds. Wedge The troop aligns itself behind a powerful commander.

Each time the chosen creature Strides, the troop follows as a free action, Striding to keep the chosen creature adjacent. Drawback The troop loses some of their autonomy.

Members Accuser Agent (Creature 9), Archer Sentry (Creature 2), Arrester Squadron (Creature 8), Barrister (Creature -1), Captain of the Guard (Creature 6), City Guard Squadron (Creature 5), Equestrian Constable (Creature 4), Executioner (Creature 6), Gendarme (Creature 8), Grand Inquisitor (Creature 15), Guard (Creature 1), Harbormaster (Creature 3), Infernal Registrar (Creature 10), Inspector (Creature 3), Jailer (Creature 3), Judge (Creature -1), Mayor (Creature 0), Prime Minister (Creature 0), Tax Collector (Creature -1), Warden (Creature 6), Watch Officer (Creature 3), Watchmage (Creature 5), Watchmage Squadron (Creature 10) At Your Service Many officials can conscript others into service in a variety of positions. These are usually other officials like guards or jailers, but some NPCs from other sections who might be conscripted include drover, guide, messenger, and tracker. On rare occasions officials are given some amount of authority over NPCs in the military. The harbormaster also can conscript the services of a bosun, dockhand, navigator, or ship captain. Crossover Ancestry NPCs Several of the NPCs elsewhere in NPC Core can fit well in this group: Big boss goblin (level 6), elven court guard (level 13), kobold egg guardian (level 3), swarm voice (level 3), tidewater guard (level 4) Delaying Tactics An official can weaponize bureaucracy. A judge might enforce an archaic law generally ignored yet still on the books. A tax collector could ask for the seal of a lord who is out of the region. The harbormaster could require all fees in local coin, fully aware that money changers won't be open for days. Deploying The Watch If no guard is present, it takes at least 1–2 rounds for a civilian to find a guard to sound an alarm whistle. If a guard was on the scene, they would sound the alarm immediately. Reinforcements typically arrive 2–3 rounds later. Deputized Adventuring Watch officers often need specialized help solving difficult criminal cases or tracking down fugitives who have evaded capture. Adventurers who are hired in as consultants are typically deputized, granting them temporary legal authority comparable to constables. They can humanely arrest suspects, perform reasonable searches and questioning, and confiscate and return stolen goods. Corrupt officers might deputize in exchange for an ample bribe if their actions are plausibly defensible. Guard Patrols High-security areas, city walls, and main streets tend to have regular guard patrols, both hourly and nightly. These patrols usually take regular breaks at gates, castles, guardhouses, jails, ports, or watchtowers. Other areas within watch jurisdiction tend to get visits sporadically, sometimes only when an alarm is raised. Intelligence Networks Complex governments rely on bureaucracies and trusted messenger systems to monitor their expansive territories, send orders, and enact large-scale decrees. Most governments formally use conventional officers to carry out their policies, but secretive or unofficial networks of more trusted agents handle more sensitive matters. They also ferret out corruption and dissent among the regular officers. Jailbreak! If a PC or ally gets imprisoned, the group might plot a jailbreak. For a complex jail or penitentiary, this might require the use of the infiltration subsystem. With a smaller town or city jail with a simple structure and small staff, it could require just a bit of force. The jailbreak might just be the beginning, leading to additional adventure! Making Bureaucracy Fun Waiting in lines and filling out forms is rarely fun in real life, so how can it be fun in your game? Keep scenes moving and allow everyone to participate. Describe how long PCs wait, but never actually force your players to wait as their characters do. The frustration of filling out forms or talking to dozens of clerks in different departments can be summarized or delivered as background. Further, if a roll isn't needed or roleplay isn't happening, the scene can simply be part of that background, meaning that even while their characters are at their wits' ends, your players are just as involved as they would be in any other social challenge. Finally, make sure every PC has some way to contribute. Off With A Warning Officers can often be convinced to drop a minor or tenuous investigation. Request with a sympathetic story (standard DC for civil infraction, hard DC for misdemeanor, very hard DC for lesser felony unlikely to go to trial) Explain away suspicious circumstances Give a bribe of about one-quarter to half the fine Invoke a jurisdiction conflict (Society with a hard DC of the officer's level) Invoke an associate powerful enough to make life difficult for the officer (Coerce, potentially Lie) Officer Ranks Some ranks within the hierarchy of security forces, from highest to lowest, include grand inquisitor, lord constable, chief inspector, royal accuser/inquisitor, sheriff, captain, inspector, reeve/ bailiff, lieutenant, gendarme, sergeant, corporal, constable, and deputy/ watchman. These titles and structures can very greatly between different settlements and cultures.

Performers Across Golarion Some of Golarion's brightest stars are as much storymakers as storytellers.

The Circus of Wayward Wonders : Perhaps the most spectacular traveling show in the Inner Sea, the Circus of Wayward Wonders and its Sideshow of Everyday Marvels offers truly outstanding acts for their audiences.

The ultimate reward for the devout is the promise of a personalized afterlife, filled with a lifetime of wealth and free of [Pharasma's](/Deities.aspx?ID=290) judgment. Not all who learn of these final revelations are up to the task, however. For the fortunate ones, a simple death is the only consequence for botching the ritual. For the less fortunate, the outcome is an undying half-life of torment. Caught between a twisted mockery of their imagined afterlife and the mortal Universe, a failed prophet will know no peace until their body is destroyed. \n\nA failed prophet resembles the skinless corpse of a humanoid ancestry covered in glowing, golden veinlike cracks.

If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life prior to the transformation, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=627) or [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=628).\n\n**Wealthsense** The failed prophet can detect concentrations of coinage and other valuables as an [imprecise sense](/Rules.aspx?ID=2407) with a range of 60 feet. The failed prophet detects any creature carrying coins and treasure totaling at least the average cost of a consumable item of the failed prophet’s level.\n\n**Immunities** [bleed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=86), [death effects](/Rules.aspx?ID=2331), [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=578), [doomed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=67), [drained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=68), [fatigued](/Conditions.aspx?ID=73), [healing](/Traits.aspx?ID=623), [nonlethal](/Traits.aspx?ID=661) attacks, paralyzed, [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=669), [sickened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=91), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95), [vitality](/Traits.aspx?ID=509), [void](/Traits.aspx?ID=510) \n\n**Weakness** [spirit](/Traits.aspx?ID=737) 10; this weakness increases to 15 at 15th level. \n\n**Resistances** [cold](/Traits.aspx?ID=555) 10, [electricity](/Traits.aspx?ID=586) 10, and physical 10 (except magical bludgeoning); these resistances increase to 15 at 15th level \n\n**Broken Mindscape** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=542), [illusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=629), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=631), mental) 30 feet. A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the aura must attempt a Will save. Use the moderate spell DC for the failed prophet’s level (GM Core 121).\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and becomes immune to broken mindscape for 1 minute.<br />**Success** The creature is [stunned](/Conditions.aspx?ID=93) 1 as disjointed visions of the failed prophet’s mindscape assail its senses.<br />**Failure** The creature’s mind is pulled into the failed prophet’s mindscape. It’s [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85) for 1 round. While paralyzed, the creature can take any actions with the [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647) or spirit traits, or that deal mental or spirit damage, as though those actions were purely mental. Such actions only have line of effect to the originating failed prophet and other creatures currently paralyzed by broken mindscape, though they treat all such creatures as though they were adjacent.<br />**Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is 1 minute or until the failed prophet is destroyed, whichever happens first.\n\n**Taboos** Despite the failed prophet’s transformed body, a lifelong adherence to the strictures of the Prophecies of Kalistrade has ingrained the philosophical prohibitions into their soul. Whenever a failed prophet is critically hit by an unarmed attack, is critically hit by or critically fails a save against a touch spell, or is exposed to a disease or poison effect (even though immune), they take a –2 status penalty to their AC, attack bonuses, DCs, Perception, saving throws, and skill modifiers for 1 minute. Breaking other Kalistocratic taboos can also trigger this penalty at the GM’s discretion.\n\n**Fists** Failed prophets have a fist unarmed Strike that deals bludgeoning damage. This attack has the [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=644) trait, reach 5 feet longer than the base creature, and triggers Greedy Grab. Use the high [Strike attack bonus](/Rules.aspx?ID=2896) and moderate Strike damage of the failed prophet’s level.\n\n**Greedy Grab** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> **Requirements** The failed prophet’s last action was a successful fist [Strike](/Actions.aspx?ID=2306) that dealt damage; **Effect** The failed prophet attempts a Thievery check against the target’s Reflex DC. On a success, the failed prophet pilfers coins and gems from the target with a total value as indicated in the table, to a maximum of what the target is carrying. Valuables in unlocked containers on the target’s person can be taken just as easily as those carried. On a critical success, the failed prophet steals double that amount.

It requires studious adherence to the strictures and taboos laid out in the Prophecies. The ultimate reward for the devout is the promise of a personalized afterlife, filled with a lifetime of wealth and free of Pharasma's judgment. Not all who learn of these final revelations are up to the task, however. For the fortunate ones, a simple death is the only consequence for botching the ritual. For the less fortunate, the outcome is an undying half-life of torment. Caught between a twisted mockery of their imagined afterlife and the mortal Universe, a failed prophet will know no peace until their body is destroyed. A failed prophet resembles the skinless corpse of a humanoid ancestry covered in glowing, golden veinlike cracks. On closer inspection, the organs and musculature are unnaturally smooth and shiny, like cured and buffed leather. Members Failed Prophet (Creature 10) Creating a Failed Prophet To create a failed prophet, apply the following steps to any living creature of at least 10th level that has failed to properly perform the Kalistocrat death ritual. They gain the construct trait. Increase the creature’s Thievery modifier to a high skill bonus of the failed prophet’s level unless it was already higher. Increase the creature’s AC, attack bonuses, DCs, Perception, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Failed Prophet Abilities Failed prophets gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life prior to the transformation, such as human or humanoid. Wealthsense The failed prophet can detect concentrations of coinage and other valuables as an imprecise sense with a range of 60 feet. The failed prophet detects any creature carrying coins and treasure totaling at least the average cost of a consumable item of the failed prophet’s level. Immunities bleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, unconscious, vitality, void Weakness spirit 10; this weakness increases to 15 at 15th level. Resistances cold 10, electricity 10, and physical 10 (except magical bludgeoning); these resistances increase to 15 at 15th level Broken Mindscape (aura, illusion, incapacitation, mental) 30 feet. A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the aura must attempt a Will save. Use the moderate spell DC for the failed prophet’s level (GM Core 121). Critical Success The creature is unaffected and becomes immune to broken mindscape for 1 minute. Success The creature is stunned 1 as disjointed visions of the failed prophet’s mindscape assail its senses. Failure The creature’s mind is pulled into the failed prophet’s mindscape. It’s paralyzed for 1 round. While paralyzed, the creature can take any actions with the mental or spirit traits, or that deal mental or spirit damage, as though those actions were purely mental. Such actions only have line of effect to the originating failed prophet and other creatures currently paralyzed by broken mindscape, though they treat all such creatures as though they were adjacent. Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is 1 minute or until the failed prophet is destroyed, whichever happens first. Taboos Despite the failed prophet’s transformed body, a lifelong adherence to the strictures of the Prophecies of Kalistrade has ingrained the philosophical prohibitions into their soul. Whenever a failed prophet is critically hit by an unarmed attack, is critically hit by or critically fails a save against a touch spell, or is exposed to a disease or poison effect (even though immune), they take a –2 status penalty to their AC, attack bonuses, DCs, Perception, saving throws, and skill modifiers for 1 minute. Breaking other Kalistocratic taboos can also trigger this penalty at the GM’s discretion. Fists Failed prophets have a fist unarmed Strike that deals bludgeoning damage. This attack has the magical trait, reach 5 feet longer than the base creature, and triggers Greedy Grab. Use the high Strike attack bonus and moderate Strike damage of the failed prophet’s level. Greedy Grab Single Action Requirements The failed prophet’s last action was a successful fist Strike that dealt damage; Effect The failed prophet attempts a Thievery check against the target’s Reflex DC. On a success, the failed prophet pilfers coins and gems from the target with a total value as indicated in the table, to a maximum of what the target is carrying. Valuables in unlocked containers on the target’s person can be taken just as easily as those carried. On a critical success, the failed prophet steals double that amount. The failed prophet gains a number of temporary Hit Points equal to the value stolen that last for 1 minute. Level Value Stolen 10-12 5d10 gp 13-15 6d10 gp 16-18 7d10 gp 19-20 8d10 gp This Is My Reality! Two Actions (concentrate) The failed prophet exerts control over their crumbling mindscape to inflict harm upon those trapped within. This can take the form of falling debris, natural disasters, or anything else the failed prophet can imagine. No matter the form, each creature currently paralyzed by the failed prophet’s broken mindscape takes spirit damage with a basic Will save. The save DC uses the high spell DC for the failed prophet’s level and the unlimited use area damage for the failed prophet’s level.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=563","weakness":{}}}]

On a critical failure, you also take an amount of fire damage equal to half your level. You can spend 10 minutes retuning your innovation and making adjustments to return it to functionality, at which point you can use unstable actions with that innovation again. To take an unstable action, you must be using your innovation (for example, wearing an armor innovation or wielding a weapon innovation). If you have a minion innovation, some unstable actions are taken by the minion instead of you. In these cases, only the minion can take that action, and the minion needs to have been Commanded that turn to take the action. If you critically fail the flat check, the minion takes the damage instead of you. Some actions have an Unstable Function entry, which you can use to add the unstable trait for a bigger benefit. If you’re unable to use unstable actions, you can still use the action normally, but you can’t use the unstable function.","trait":["Unstable"],"trait_group":["Class-Specific"],"trait_markdown":"Unstable","trait_raw":["Unstable"],"type":"Trait","url":"/Traits.aspx?ID=416","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"trait-417","_score":3.7953854,"_source":{"category":"trait","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"trait-417","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Trait\">[Combination](/Traits.aspx?ID=417)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Treasure Vault](/Sources.aspx?ID=191) pg. 217 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\nCombination weapons combine the functionality of melee weapons and ranged weapons in unique or unusual ways.

A creature immune to mental effects can’t use a possession effect. While possessing a target, a possessor’s true body is unconscious (and can’t wake up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount of damage as mental damage.\n\nA possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities that affect its physical body, though it gains the benefits of the target’s active spells and abilities that affect their body. A possessor can use any of the target’s abilities that are purely physical, and it can’t use any of its own abilities except spells and purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or purely mental. A possessor uses the target’s attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save, Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills, spell attack modifier, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant (the possessor’s invested items apply when using its own values, and the target’s invested items apply when using the target’s values). A possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn’t in its own body. The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act.\n\nIf a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body. If the target dies, the possession ends immediately, and the possessor is stunned for 1 minute.","name":"Possession","primary_source":"Player Core","primary_source_raw":"Player Core pg. 459","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2023-11-15","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Player Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=216) pg. 459 <sup>2.0</sup>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nEffects with this trait allow a creature to project its mind and spirit into a target.

A creature immune to mental effects can’t use a possession effect. While possessing a target, a possessor’s true body is unconscious (and can’t wake up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount of damage as mental damage. A possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities that affect its physical body, though it gains the benefits of the target’s active spells and abilities that affect their body. A possessor can use any of the target’s abilities that are purely physical, and it can’t use any of its own abilities except spells and purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or purely mental. A possessor uses the target’s attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save, Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills, spell attack modifier, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant (the possessor’s invested items apply when using its own values, and the target’s invested items apply when using the target’s values). A possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn’t in its own body. The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act. If a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body. If the target dies, the possession ends immediately, and the possessor is stunned for 1 minute.","trait":["Possession"],"trait_group":["Mechanics"],"trait_markdown":"Possession","trait_raw":["Possession"],"type":"Trait","url":"/Traits.aspx?ID=671","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"trait-672","_score":3.7953854,"_source":{"category":"trait","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"trait-672","legacy_id":["trait-130"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Trait\">[Potion](/Traits.aspx?ID=672)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Player Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=216) pg. 459 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\nA potion is a consumable magical liquid activated when you drink it.","name":"Potion","primary_source":"Player Core","primary_source_raw":"Player Core pg. 459","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2023-11-15","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Player Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=216) pg. 459 <sup>2.0</sup>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nA potion is a consumable magical liquid activated when you drink it.\r\n</summary>","skill_mod":{},"source":["Player Core"],"source_raw":["Player Core pg. 459"],"source_category":["Rulebooks"],"source_markdown":"[Player Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=216) pg. 459 <sup>2.0</sup>","speed":{},"summary":"A potion is a consumable magical liquid activated when you drink it.","summary_markdown":"A potion is a consumable magical liquid activated when you drink it.","text":" Potion Source Player Core pg. 459 2.0 A potion is a consumable magical liquid activated when you drink it.","trait":["Potion"],"trait_group":["Equipment"],"trait_markdown":"Potion","trait_raw":["Potion"],"type":"Trait","url":"/Traits.aspx?ID=672","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon58","_id":"trait-673","_score":3.7953854,"_source":{"category":"trait","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"trait-673","legacy_id":["trait-131"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Trait\">[Precious](/Traits.aspx?ID=673)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [GM Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=218) pg. 332 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\nValuable materials with special properties have the precious trait.

It activates when you drink it, which uses it up. Magic tea has the potion and tea traits. When you craft a dose of magic tea, the raw materials you supply are in the form of unusual and costly tea leaves. The process of crafting magic tea includes infusing the leaves with magical reagents, purifying the water, and steeping the tea in the water, resulting in what's essentially a particularly delicious-tasting potion. You can activate magic tea with an Interact action as you drink it or feed it to another creature, as if it were a potion. You can also activate magic tea with a 10-minute activity that requires sterling tea ware (these artisan's tools can be shared by up to four people who take this activity simultaneously) to prepare the tea and then consume it or present it to someone during a short tea ceremony, after which the magic tea's effects begin; activating magic tea in this way enhances its effect, as detailed in each entry's Tea Ceremony below. Once you drink a dose of magic tea, you're temporarily immune to that particular type of magic tea for 24 hours.
